        "text": " has been done, has been implemented, where a lot of these sort of IRP inputs get fixed in the embedded cost of, or embedded avoided cost price that gets calculated at the time the power purchase agreement is executed and so stays consistent throughout the term of the agreement. And then the last two concerns is that it undermines the QF's ability to design a battery to meet the identified capacity need at the time the contract is executed. So, for example, as staff noted, if the need initially identified as something like four to 08:00 p.m. the QF might design a bigger, longer battery than if it were at twelve to 04:00 p.m. and if that ships over the term, the QF may not be able to recover the cost of that bigger battery. And so that brings me to the fourth concern, which is that it undermines the QF's ability to obtain financing. So it's Nu Sun's experience that financers will take the safest and most conservative look at the project and the contract and what might occur over the course of the contract, and they will want to ensure that the costs will be recovered under sort of a worst case scenario. And so providing for a fixed price option would help solve these issues. And if it's the commission's preference to only have one option pursued going forward, it's Nuan's recommendation that that one price stream be a fixed price option for the QF. And I also have Jake Stevens on the line here to help answer any of these. Any technical or financing questions that you might. Yeah, unfortunately, we've got a really tight agenda today, so I think we got to keep it moving. But I did want to make sure that we clarified one thing. You're suggesting that even though the energy and capacity avoided cost payment wouldn't change, you're suggesting that changing the hours would somehow sort of implicate the principle that the payment should be fixed. Is there any sort of precedent for that? Well, so my understanding is that if the hours change, then it could impact the QF s ability to capture the value from those hours. Because if the hours are shifted to a time when the solar is already generating, then the project wouldn't be able to dispatch its battery at the same time to capture that value. No, I understand the argument you're making, but I'm just asking if there's any sort of precedent to support that. That. I mean, that that falls under the same legal principles as. As changing the rate. Well, they're going to be paid in a lower price overall, so, I mean, maybe. Okay. All right, good enough. I just wanted to make sure that we didn't have, like, some precedent on point from someone that had decided that legal issue. Any other questions for Marie? Okay. All right, let's go to Ellie Hardwick and then Jack Watson, please. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, commissioner. Chair Decker, commissioners Thompson and Tani. For the record, my name is Elie Harwick and I am representing the Northwest and Intermountain Power Producers Coalition and the Renewable Energy Coalition. We submitted joint comments with Korea, so we're just going to keep it short and saying we support the oral comments Mister Adam has made today on Behf of Korea. We have nothing to add, but I'm available to answer any questions or defer questions to Mister Adams if they're more appropr ##iate to him. But we are in SP support of what Mister Adams has said. Okay, thank you very much. Let's go to Jack Watson. Good morning. Chair Decker, Commissioners Tani, and Thompson. For the record, my name is Jack Watson. I'm the director of policy and regulatory affairs for the Oregon Solar and Storage Industries association. I'll keep my comments brief to avoid repeating some of the things you've already heard, but I would like to start by commending staff and stakeholders for reaching consensus on many of the areas of the interim solar and storage rate proposal. This is something that we think is necessary as we ramp up to meet our climate goals, and it has been refreshing to collaboratively find so much common ground so quickly. OA is supportive of the Q of Trade association's comments on premium peak hours. The variable premium peak hours may present challenges for financing and design facilities, as you've already heard. Accordingly, offering both a variable and fixed option will allow developers to choose which is most appropriate. And we'd echo Nuance's comment that if you pursue only one, that the fixed option is preferred. And lastly, OCA is supportive of the flexibility and staff's proposal on QF eligibility requirements. It makes a lot of sense to allow for optionality now as we do not know what the rates will look like, nor do we know the cost of different size and duration batteries. This option will enable developers to design their solar and storage project to be more economically viable. Thank you for your time and I'm available to answer any",

        "text": " wind and solar. We'll likely see we don't need to just kind of do an accounting methodology and add them up one for one. We can probably interconnect more than our nameplate capacity across those transmission facilities. And so yeah, we, so we'll get 667, we allow it to add about a thousand megawatts of additional capacity. And those are some of the ways we're optimizing it. But we would expect to have further optimization in looks out in the future when we get closer to putting these in service and actually interconnecting these facilities. And. Sorry, just one final question here. I see that these are coming in, in your plan in 29, 31 ballpark. Can you characterize the permitting status on, on these at a high level? Yeah, we still need to go through some state permitting efforts on the facilities and it's really pretty much at the county level that that will occur. We do have BLM permits at this point and so the big permitting hurdle is over, but there is a fair amount of local work that needs to be done, and we're working with Pacific Core on that at this time. Oay, thanks. Yeah, thank you. Can actually, just before we go forward, can I just clarify that the transaction, joint purchase and sale agreement, where you're sort of across that same pathway across the bottom of Idaho, the Stank river valley, your St. River plain, you're on slide 13. That you can accomplish with existing builds. You don't have to build to accomplish giving pack the 300 direction and 600 other direction. We need to install a second transformer at midpoint and an upgraded series capacitor at midpoint in Kimport. And so some substation upgrades are required, but no transmission line. Right. Just some upgrade. Okay. And then when we look. So you can complete that whole piece by 2026, and then you come to this more substantial build sort of across the same pie of landscape. Midpoint to Hemingway. That's right. Okay. And this is a joint project with speccific core. And so it's serving their load, it's connecting their pack, Eastonpack west, but also serving your load growth. Is that sort of the. It's doing both? Yes. Yep. Pacific Core would have, you know that 1300 ish megawatts of that, that 2000 segment to utilize for, for their purposes, they may be bottlenecked at Hemingway a little bit because b two h doesn't have enough capacity to probably facilitate the entire gateway west for them. And so we'll to figure out how to, how to approach that. But one of the benefits of the gateway segment is that it unlocks 1000 additional east to west transfer capability across b two h, because this is kind of the bottleneck. As soon as b two h gets put in service, you essentially have 2500 kb west of Hemingway, but only 1500 kb line between Hemingway and midpoint. And so as soon as one of these gets built. Yeah. B two h can be upgraded or upgraded by about 1000 mw that Idaho power and Pacific war will share in. And so there's other ancillary benefits to gateway west besides integrating additional renewables. It's gaining additional transfer capabilities as well. And that transfer capability on b two h is beyond what we have talked about in the IRP before in the CPCN for v two h and so on. That's outside of that justification, or that was always sort of part of what was articulated for b two h and justifying b two h. Yeah, good question. Commission Tommy. I think that we discussed it in the PCN five case, but I do not believe that it was discussed at great length in the IRP and the 21 IRP. And from our, from our standpoint, it is really an export increase. And so it, it doesn't really land under the IRP like export possibilities, but it does, you know, increase your capability of you moving those renewable resources around for geographic diversity purposes and whatnot. But it hasn't been a big IRP benefit to gain additional export capability. I see. I see. That's helpful. And then sort of last question. You're talking about being able to interconnect a lot of renewables to this. Help me understand who's managing the interconnection queue on these lines, because I presume folks are already asking to interconnect to these lines. Yes. Well, it is either us or Pacific Corps. We allow in our joint ownership and operating agreement an interconnection customer to connect to either of us because we each are transmission owners and kind of tenants in common. So that's been our approach there. And we do have quite a few interconnections all across southern Idaho. And yes, I think we're managing probably the vast majority of them, but I think Pacificor does have some in their queue at various stations along the way. Okay. Okay. That's",

        "text": ", well, it does sound like we're in agreement, just that this is useful issue for investigation and we can consider additional approaches, approaches on how to calculate this deliverability concern. And I do want to take a moment just to maybe redirect us here just for the moment, and see if we can. Well, okay, let me say we will take time to go over each individual issue. And so, as we move through this process, please raise your comments as pertains to staff's goals. Do you think we miss something here? And then we will come back to the issue by issue. Yeah, so a couple of on the maybe things that seemed like they might have been missed here. I think, first of all, we appreciate and support the SSR concept and look forward to working through that. I think one of the issues that I think we were told in a variety of other purpa dockets would come up later in the opportunity to revisit standard PPA size and rates was one of the questions. And so it seems like there should be a set of standard rates for up to 20 mw that kind of incorporate those premiums for that type of compliance, but then also moving standard rates and tracks up to full 80 mw should be on the table given the size of the procurement and decarbonization needs. And we understood that would be potentially back on the table here. And then I think another big question is, you know, in a world of some pretty big rate increases, one can't help but wonder, given historical reliance on the market by at least the two bigger ious and interactions with those, you know, what extent of those rate increases is being driven by procurement from the market. And, you know, should there be a sort of greater of build cost and, you know, mid sea market prices construct if utility is essentially procuring material parts of their power out in the market at you 100 do, 200, 500 do, $1,000 a megawatt hour, you know, maybe not a spot market basis, but on a forward projections basis, if those are going to be material parts of their resource plans. So looking at that element, I think should be considered. Appreciate that. Jake, any other comments about overall goals, any remaining issues to raise that are maybe not contemplated here? All right, one more also like the availability to have rates for, I mean, it seems like a lot of ppas in the rfps are out to 25 years or longer. Even so, to what extent availability of fixed rates for longer than the current 15 year period should be in bounds. And I think was put off in other dockets to this one when it came up before. And then another one is kind of how avoidance of penalties or carbon costs to become compliant are going to be contemplated. If one presumes that in 2030 the percent of carbon content, emissions or utility is going to match the law, they will have choices to buy their way into compliance, presumably, and or exposures to penalties. And how are we going to look at that? And then finally, I think finally, if there's other things like blackst start capabilities that should be considered and as we look at the capacity resources, you. Yeah. How many hours and what blend of those battery storage resources is appropriate given the 24/7 needs. Thanks. Thank you. Yeah, Dan Big Neil. So one of the things that we didn't see addressed here was the extent to which this is supposed to address both standard and non standard avoided costs. So the extent there's an avoided cost calculation and it's good, it should be able to be with minor adaptations for real distinctions between standard and non standard. It should app fly to either. I't if you're going to set a price once a year and put it on a piece of paper, it could be a little complicated in the same way that a nonstandard project is. So whatever the distinctions that you intended for this process would be interested to know. Yeah, I definitely appreciate that, Dan. We were thinking about standard rates and would like to hear more about that. Much appreciated. Let's see. Chris Pleasant. Hey Ryan, this is Jimmy Lind. PGE. Yeah, just on the goal slide that is being displayed. I think, you know, one thing we'd like to comment on or just sort of draw attention to is on your last bullet point with respect to the customer at different standard. I'm expecting that in this docket we'll be discussing quite a few different approaches regarding valuation, regarding pricing. In this proposal itself, there's a number of resource valuation adjustment proposals, adders. I think one thing that PGE will be is hoping that staff shares an opinion on is whatever methodology we arrive at, it's going to be important that we aren't establishing avoided cost prices that are like obviously in excess of what the demonstrated avoided cost is shown to be through resource",

        "text": " required to explore innovative potential improvements and solutions. Any refinements to the DSP guideline should continue to encourage these core principles of innovation, open and thoughtful dialogue and pragmatism. Again, just wanted to thank, thank you for this acceptance and the company is looking forward to continuing its efforts to further advance and evolve its DSP processes. Thank you. Were there any and. Yeah, sorry, go ahead. No, go ahead. Oh, I wasnna say I. And I can provide, I can augment. I wasn't sure earlier whether, you know, I guess to augment some of the, some of the responses that Nick provided to. Yeah, I think there were a couple, couple questions in there that would benefit from company positions if you're willing to provide them. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Um, yeah, so I think it was Commissioner Tawy's question was that feedback loop between performance data of system and PAC data and, and you referenced using fault data, reliability data as well as stress on the grid. So as far as for, for this BSP process, um, you know, we, the two transitional study areas that we looked at, um, uh, was a result of we had an initial criteria that we developed for selection of those areas and it was meant to facilitate, implement, well, I guess evaluation of non wire solutions. So we had things like, you know, whether there was Scada availability. What if there was any capacity for ders and things like, things like that? And I think in the future, you know, especially now that we're, you know, with some of the, some of the developments and the CEB, with the CBR portion, everything I think will, um, will be, I think that criteria as far as, you know, some of that reliability data and um, even, you know, resilience information, um, could, could be incorporated into, um, or I guess be considered, um, for um, selection of uh, you know, other areas that we, we may, you know, further study. And I think, you know, the other thing with that is as we've been working through this first round of DSP, I think we've found there's a lot of new data and tool sets that, I mean we're currently developed, but we need to develop to get the visibility, we need to consider those, those other, that, those other, that other criteria. So I don't know if that's more, I guess, if that answers u your question earlier, Commissioner Tawy, but that is kind of. Or if that helps, um, augment. That's, um. That's great. That's great. And I think that's the, in my mind, that's part of the point of DSP, right. Is a forcing mechanism to engage those questions. Not that we'll always have all the answers that were in that we're on that journey of engaging those questions. So that, that's great. Thank you. And was there, I know there were several other questions. Was there any other questions? I think, yeah. My question about sort of what should the commissioners be expecting in terms of follow up on the identified non wires solutions? Do you have any sense of that company's perspective? Yeah. Yeah. So with, so those nodwire solutions that we evaluated forlimate falls that provided a lot of learnings that helped us evolve some of our processes going into our, our future study areas. And I think for, for that area, I mean, you know, one of the findings is that non, non traditional or non wire solutions, you know, they, they take a lot, they require more analysis, they take more time to implement. Therefore, we need to look, you know, farther ahead potentially in our study horizon. So we have time to incorporate those solutions and, and also, you know, the, I guess, the risks associated with those as well. So the grid need we were trying to address in Kimate Falls was an overapacity issue and that was actually what we found to be one of the most common grid needs when we look back into our distribution planning studies. So it provided a good platform to, I guess, for us to build out a template that. Okay, you know, if we have an overcapacity issue, what are some different non wire solutions we would consider? And, you know, with that. With that grid need, we found the timing just didn't, didn't allow for some of the solutions we considered was energy efficiency. And that, that proved to be, I think, from our cost benefit analysis, you know, is more cost effective than the solar plus storage, but it. It requires a lot more time to be implemented. And that, that grid need. That we had needed to be addressed in one to two year time frame, which didn't allow enough time to implement the non wire solution.",

        "text": ", which is 87%, or it's going to run that out from the 86.9 something. And that turns out to be we're going to divide this value between these 1068 hours. Now, the other columns that we have here are the same calculation that we have before, but we change the inputs that you have. So now the value of the capacity is your capacity value times u lcc that you have in there converted to megawatt hours. And the capacity allocated to the peak hours is that total part of money divided by the total hours. So 1068. And if we go into the final results here. So the premium peak hours is going to be your value of the capacity plus the energy, the value of the energy minus the integration cost. And for the off peak, we only have the energy minus the integration cost. So these are the two parts of the premium peak hours. We will apply for those 1068 hours. So 4 hours per day of Monday to Saturday, excluding their holidays, and all the other hours will be the off peak that we have. Pretty short and sweet. And I'have. Any questions for rooo power question, do you have any work paapers supporting this? That could be made available like Pacific Corin. We have a set of spreadsheet that we submitted, but some of that contains confial information. I don't know how it will handle the rest. I will proly leave mark. Or don't want to answer that. Yeah, because it does have confidential information. We are. Certain parties to, um, 1730 have signed protective agreements and we'll be able to give them access. But if you haven't signed a protective agreement, I don't think we can send you the full set of work papers. Adam and or Donovan, do you have anything to elaborate? No, that's correct. We submitted the work papers along with the filing, just as we do in the normal course. So they were. They were filed. But if you did not sign the protective order or had not signed it yet, you would not have access to those work papers. And Andreas, this is Ryan Bain. I just wanted to verify again that your premium peak hours were determined without relying on any market price factors. Is that correct? That is correct. Entirely. Entire base on lolps for the system. Thank you. And then, Irne, I think you might have had a question. Sorry to jump in there. Yeah, Adam, did you send those out to all the parties that had signed the protective order? Or if you haven't, could you. Yeah, we can circulate him. And I see that Kevin Higgins signed the protective order as well. Awesome. Well, thank everyone. Thank you so much. Andres, any last calls for any questions for Idaho powers team? Okay, Chris pleasant, are you? I think we're doing so well on time. We might just go ahead and keep moving along here. Okay. Yep, I am ready. Thanks much. Sorry about that. To share my screen, I did some slides. Can everyone see my screen? It is coming through. Okay, so in our fil, we did some slides that on the topics we wanted to cover about our interim solar plus storage rate. And then I'm also happy to present the workbook work paper if anyone has any questions. So we'll go through the proxy resource, the steps we used to develop the solar plus storage pricing, how we did the capacity contribution calculation. We have some auroran power decks, heat map maps to show you, and then our proposed premium peak hours, and then some results of a PGE dispatch model. Hey, Chris, it's Jordan. Yep. I think the way you're presenting, we're not seeing the slide you're looking at in the full screen. Just wanted to before you got too far. Sorry about that. I have not done this in a while. No problem. Yeah, you might have the presenter view checked under slideshow. I'll just do it this. Can you guys see my screen now? Oh, I'm having not. I'll just. I'll just do it this way and not do it in Slideshow view this works. Yeah. So, as per the order, we produced a representative generation profile of a proxy solar plus storage resource with a one to one solar ratio and a four hour battery duration. And we use the characteristics as described in our 2023 IRP. The generation profile reflects a solar plus storage resource that charges exclusively from the onite solar resource and prioritizes discharged daily during the four hour period for each month with the highest loss of load probability. And so these are the steps we did to develop the price. So, identify the highest loss of load probability hours in our sequoia model, we produce a solar and storage generation profile in the storage dispatch model that aligns with the highest loss of load probability hours. We model",

        "text": " two context about that choice. You're absolutely right that with renewable penetration increasing, really the designation between that capacity resource we start bleeding over, especially when the capacity contribution of that battery is so dependent on the energy resources and vice versa. We heard a lot today in this meeting about potentially counterintuitive ELCC results to which the company'happy to respond. But a lot of them have to do with what system you're evaluating, what resource, at what time, and all the intricacies there. So in terms of that designation, acknowledging the arbitrariness of it, we think that there is some logic for the four hour battery being the dispatchable resource, the next dispatchable resource that in the near term we're looking to add. But I think there are reasonable differences of opinion there. And so we chose that to go forward with this 1728 and the 1893 docent is well in the near term, but very open to alternative suggestions there. Appreciate the candid response there, Seth, because I think what that acknowledges for me is that the system that we have set up, which is looking to the IRP to determine these things is frankly something that I see that staff proposal in, um, 2000 as moving away from it. And so there is going to be an element of sort of art in moving and translating one to the other. So I appreciate that response, and I don't think I want to delve too much deeper into the intuitions around the results right the second. But I'm happy to have other commissioners ask questions if they want follow up. All right. And I don't think, Jake, that we're going to go back to sort of cross talk here. I think we need to move to some deliberation about where we're headed here. And if we're headed in a direction where we want to dive down into those issues further, then we may come back for more comment from staff and, and into more public comment. I think these situations are always uncomfortable for commissioners, and administrative price setting sort of defines what's uncomfortable. It's not an exact science, and we have certain principles that guide us in our current framework, and there are a lot around fidelity to the IRP, or translation from the IRP, if you will, with some updates, because in the framework we have, that was considered to be an important way to discipline avoided cost filings and reduce the burden. I think we're all feeling like we're maybe a lot more sophisticated right now and the world is changing a lot faster than it was at the time that that framework was adopted and that we have better information about up to the moment circumstances. And from my perspective, even if that's true, and this is sort implied in my question, it's not in my mind where we should put our scarce resources. I'd rather see us accelerate the transition of the framework to something that allows us to balance the administrative, see an accuracy of the avoided costs then to delve down here. But I think it's, people are making fair points, too, that there may be one or two or three things that would be worth it. And I am, you know, very interested to hear my colleague'sense of that trade off. And if the trade off and balance is different than maybe I'm seeing it, how narrowly we can define any further scope of inquiry here. Thanks for that chair. And I want to appreciate everyone digging into the record and PP responding to data requests. I think you captured well share the challenge of this moment of transition in the larger grid and what that means then, for our approach to administratively setting prices. We have worked hard to have an internally consistent logic to setting those prices. We've used that logic. We've tried to be very disciplined about how we use it. And we recognize that that logic doesn't have to evolve to match the new resource mix that's coming to the grid. The old logic, but doesn't meet the decarbonization requirements that or doesn't prioritize the carbonization requirements that the legislature'made, it also doesn't adapt very comfortably to the intermittent resources and on and we've laid years of groundwork trying to get to that new framework. I would really like to finish that and have that disciplined approach. I think that there's going to be dispute about the inputs that's a part of administrative pricing and id rather focus on moving to that framework than adjudicating disputes about the inputs. For this round, I think weve run our process and come out with a reasonable approach. Id like to finish the evolution that were in the midst of in um 2000 and pour our resour there. I want to recognize what I'm hearing in part is struggle with the new level of complexity ELCC and tuned models and what's in that tuning and so on. There's a level of complexity here that we're all really struggling with and it gives me caution as we think about how to implement a solution in um 2000 that it has to be understandable on a rapid turnaround time.

        "text": " is not like, to the extent it's not slightly expensive to theense, it's not like slightly hard, this is the maximum. And so your job is essentially to find out how far can you go before it isn't practicable, not slightly practical. And thus our ask of this as the relevance is to you to use your bully pulpit and your discretion and say, you know, you will facilitate utilities, you shall show us, you shall require bidders to quantify and demonstrate these things. You shall have a trade off. You shall show us what everything in state looks like and what some of those options are. And you could show us the opposite, but. And then we're going to seek and facilitate and score and prioritize to the maximument pract. There is some judgment call in there, but thus far it is essentially being swept aside as if making that balance is inconsistent with other provisions that it's not. Section three literally says that the measurement. Could you wrap up your comments please? Yes. Yes sir. The measurement of these reductions is measured as a function of their compliance with sections one through 15 to the extent compliance is consistent with one through 15 of the act. So also the plain language of even how we measure reductions is done here. And I would say as you look to other standards like the public interest and practicality, what is the public interest? A battery that keeps the lights on by increasing resiliency. That's in Eugene instead of Wyoming, accomplishes that more than otherwise. And so you can balance those things and use these policies to determine what the state has decided it is its priorities for you to implement as you go about from your privileged position here. Thank you Mister Stevens. We will now be moving on to renewable Northwest and the Northwest Energy Coalition. Mister Green, for five minutes. Thank you Judge Melgrin, and good morning again, chair decker and commissioner. Mister Green, before you go, I did just want to quickly call on climate solutions. I know that they were combined with N Sun, but really briefly, Mister beIN. Yeah, thank you Judge Mogra. I'll be very brief. We rely on our briefs on this issue. I want to reiterate one point which is, but I think the policy statement on regarding benefits to Oregonians really connects up to the standard for small scale renewables in the state and gives force to that. So although I think those policy statements, as others have said, really are kind of general in guidance that they are given force by the provisions requiring small scale renewables, I also just want to really, really briefly address a narrow, but I think important point, which is in the joint utilities reply brief. In footnote four, on page one, they incorrectly state that climate solutions reference an Oregon attorney general manual and properperly comprises legal arguments. Attorney general manuals are not law. And the attorney general, on words, an informational resource for the public. That's fine. We can. Yeah, I just wanted to make that point. Thank you. Go ahead. Thank you. And Mister Green, back to you for your time. Thank you. Again, I'll be quite brief. We briefed this issue pretty extensively in our written brief. I think Mister Stevens is correct that you representatives here of the state of Oregon, as such, your authority is bounded by the constitutional framework in which you operate. We address those questions of what those bounds look like in our brief, and what we suggested as perhaps an imperfect but permissible solution to this issue is to look at the policy statements of HB 2021 when considering the public interest in reviewing a clean energy plan. Section five two f authorizes you to consider such other factors as you deem appropriate. That seems like a fairly neat place to potentially import some of those concepts and do so in a way that is holistic and flexible and does not raise some of those constitutional concerns. With that said, I will stand down, and I'm happy to take questions. I guess the only question I have for you on that is whether you have in the time, I suppose, since you finished writing these briefs, any more to say about what kind of beyond sor of a narrative explanation of how its plan will result in, as your brief says, meaningful living wage, jobs, workforce equity and ins, security and resiliency. Have any other structures for accomplishing that showing occurred to you? And it's fine if the answer is no. I can think of only one to date which actually gels with what Mister Basin just said. I believe we renew NW west specifically and not Northwest Energy coalition raised in our comments in LC 82 the suggestion that that particular policy statement regarding benefits to local communities did likely have particular import in the context of considering small scale renewables and the small scale renewable requirement that was included in HP 2021, just based on the history of that issue that I probably do not need to repeat here because you are amply",

        "text": " allow people to actually comply with the rules and achieve the result we're trying to get. I mean, I think we would be willing to agree to the same language as the division 29 rule, kind of like what staff has here. Happy to strike the. When operated in compliance with the interconnection agreement, if that's causing concern for the utilities. But I think we'd have to consider something that's focused solely on an inverter, which is, I think, different. And you're going to have an inconsistency potentially with the division 29 rules, which I don't think, I guess I don't necessarily agree that that's a problem, but I know that you do. Well, I do, because these rules are going to be, in fact, for quite a while. Other things that become standard to achieve the result we're talking about and hope to get, which is your system lim. Your generator and system are limited to 10 mw. So if we have only one way to do that with inverters, we could be excluding a category of future technology. So I don't think we want to agree to that. Well, it seems like the first step is to figure out what sort of. To Stephanie's question, what policy we're trying to implement here. And then the second step is to refine the language. I do think we would have a number of changes to the division 29 language if we'going. To be used in this way. And we can provide those, if that would be helpful. But I think it would be helpful for us to know that that's the route we're going. Yeah, I mean, from our perspective that there's two policies. I mean, one is for there to be consistency between the division 29 measurement and rules, and these small generator rules. And the second is to have rules that are flexible enough that they accommodate new technologies. I mean, clearly focusing. I think everyone seems to agree. Focusing on what we started with, the maximum rated power of the individual components doesn't achieve that objective, even with existing storage and solar. And so, in our view, the easiest way to do that is to use the same language as division 29, like staffs proposed here. But we are, I mean, we're certainly willing to work through reasonable concerns. The utilities might have to adjust that language. So I don't know if we'll accomplish that on the workshop here today, but I think that's probably as far as we can get with the issue. Okay, I guess we'll move forward to the, the second slide here. Is there thoughts on the division, the residential potential changes? And this is ir. Yoki, you may want to speak to this first. Yeah, sure. Thanks, Ted. So the thinking here is to align the requirements of tier one for small systems in both the NEM rules as well as division 82. And I'm not proposing to change the size for residential systems. So, you know, to the extent that, you know, the NE rules have a separate requirement that residential systems, besides a certain way, the intent here is not to change that. The intent to say is just to say if there are any projects that meet the 25 kilowatt export capacity, 50 kilowatt nameplate rating, you know, requirement, which I assume would mostly be non residential NEM projects that are that small, that they would have the ability to take advantage of the streamlined and quicker process for small projects. So thank you. Thanks for the clarification. I was assuming because the residential, we're at 25 kw, you're looking for to change those, but you're just talking about commercial, who are 25 kilowws of export is what I'm hearing here. Is that correct? Yeah, I'm not, Ire ReC doesn't take a position on changing, you know, the size of net metering projects. We focus on the technical requirements for interconnection and the process associated with that. So I'm not opposing it, I'm just not taking a position because that's not the reason for our participation today. Okay. Okay, thank you very much. Any thoughts from any of the parties on this? Okay. Hearing nothing. I guess we'll move forward to the next slide. Wait, can we wait? Sure. There's no comment on this. Was that Jordan I just heard? Yeah, I was just, we had conveyed this to Ted previously, but I think the joint utilities don't oppose the concept of aligning the two. We, I think we need to look carefully how we do that. If we start changing division 39 definitions, those could have other impacts that are unintended. So we wanted to look closely at that. But in concept, I don't think there was an objection. So under this, I guess, sorry, this stephaniegan. But so in that metering projects, they have storage, is that they can have storage, is that right? Do you mean under this",

        "text": " public input meetings, the distribution system planning, stakeholder workshops, and the transportation electrification program engagement. All of this information we've tried to make it as easy as possible. We have a consolidated hub for communications on our website for folks to go to and figure out where when they can participate. Next slide, please. The community benefit indicators or CBI's. So as I mentioned, these are designed to demonstrate the impact of our proposed programs, actions and investments. And while each CBI has a desired outcomes, the metrics will measure our progress over time. We've identified six interim CBI's and 14 different metrics in the five categories of resilience, health and community well being, environmental impacts, energy equity and economic impacts. We do treat these as interim. We know that they will continue to evolve over time and with more engagement and input from stakeholders. Next slide, please. So I'm just going to hit like the main substance of this, which just kind of to walk without going into too much detail. But I do want to point out that the CBI's that we developed really we were able to build on the process that we had undertaken in Washington in 2021 as we started to implement the Clean Energy Transformation act there. And that process, we had a very public engagement process to develop CBI's for Washington. We drew on that experience for our Oregon plan. That process in Washington is ongoing still. We're still evolving those CBI's a year and a half after filing. So that's where we recognize that it. We'll continue to take that input in Oregon as well. On the topic of resilience, we will seek to improve resilience during energy outages and reduce the frequency and duration of those outages in vulnerable communities, health and community well being. We are re looking to seek to decrease the number of residential disconnections, environmental impacts. We will increase energy from not many resource and meet emissions reduction targets. Energy equity the goal is to increase the proportion of households experience, to decrease the proportion of households experiencing high energy burden and then economic impacts. We will focus on increasing community focused efforts and investments. So much more to come on that over time, but we feel pretty good about our starting point. Next slide resiliency. So the objective on the resilience risk the objective is to include resilience risk scores in our project and program prioritization. There is no current industry consensus on how to measure resilience. So this is one where in particular we're looking for engagement on how to define resiliencyure and establish the goals and metrics we've had. As I mentioned, we've had engagement series on that. We're also the next couple. We're really focusing on delivering what else do we need to be looking at and looking for that engagement. It's also really critical with the CBR and small scale. They're very interrelated. So all three of those processes really continue to evolve. Community based in the next slide, please. So these are projects that must benefit communities and resiliency. Evu in evaluating the CBR. They are directly tied to resilience and establishing goals for our system. We have as part of our CEP, we did develop a preliminary potential study where we've identified 95 future potential CBR capacity over the next six years or so to get to 2030. We're still looking for more information, more interest. What more do folks want to do on that? What else can we be working on? We have developed a specific action plan around the CBR which is on the next slide, please. So really focusing on five areas. One is working on what we can be doing. Where are those partnerships that we can be better engaged with? The Energy Trust of Oregon. What are the federal grant opportunities, the request for proposals? Randy Baker is gonna talk about this later when we get to the action plan, but we're looking at doing a procurement for small scale renewable projects to meet the 10% small scale renewable goal by 2030. There's such a potential opportunity of interdependence there that we're looking to develop. Like how can we incorporate that into both the, into meeting the CBR targets as well as the small scale renewable targets? We have a straw proposal. We're looking for feedback on from stakeholders for expanding our community resilience, battery storage grant pilot and then lastly, as I already mentioned, we're looking at feedback on our potential study that we identified and we have put out and are looking for a community in feedback, really on a community survey of what folks are interested in in this area, because we hope to issue that survey later this year, but we're trying to reach as many communities as possible through that process. So I think next slide, please. And with that, we're going to turn to the IRP and Randy Baker, thank you. Are you able to see and hear me? Yes. Looking good. Thanks. Oh, fantastic.

        "text": " commission, and I think we all appreciate having a non lawyer around to keep us practical. She's got a really strong background in the electricity business model, regulation and clean energy development. She provides a really important perspective in commission discussions because of that. And then finally, we have our shortest serving commissioner who's been with us since 2019, so still a decent amount of time, but he is technically the newest commissioner, Mark Thompson. And Mark is an attorney with a background in energy and administrative law. He has the background that is particularly valuable because he used to work on the utility side but also represented some consumer own utilities and developers of projects. He it brings a unique perspective and has seen inside a couple different worlds, and that helps inform his, his engagement in decision making. Just a reminder and something that I always reflect on and find impressive. Our commissioners must decide hundreds of individual issues and cases every year, many of them consisting of very complicated topics and a variety of competing positions and objectives that have to be weighed. And so it's a real heavy duty for them to take on. And I will say, having worked with them pretty directly, they take it very seriously and they are very engaged, and that's not always the case in other states. I think we're quite lucky here in Oregon to have such engaged commissioners who really, really focus on the public interest when they make a decision. They may have different views of what that public interest is at varying times, but it really is at the front and center of their decision making. And so to manage all these decisions, we have a lot of support here at the commission, and we're going to talk a little about that right now. So because our commissioners must decide all these questions, we need that support. And commission staff provides the bulk of it. So they analyze filings, legislation, and then they make specific recommendations to the commission on ways to address and resolve all the issues that we have to take a look at. They do it in every type of case that we manage, and we're going to talk quite a bit about the different types of cases to give you a flavor for how you can participate in them. But in each one, staff has an important role. A big part of their role is to facilitate stakeholder engagement and to understand and communicate what stakeholders are saying, if you work any amount of time with the commission, you're going to engage with staff, and staff is going to want to listen to what you have to say. The administrative hearings division, what we do, and I'm responsible for the management of administrative hearings division, we manage the process of decision making for all of our cases that are trial like cases. We essentially run those trials. We support public meetings. We support the behind the scenes internal decision development, and then we manage what's called the filing center here at the commission, which is really any piece of a paper, be it hard paper or electronic paper, as usually is these days, that comes into the commission, and it's a lot gets put through the filing center and gets managed in our docketing system, which we also run. All right, so let's talk a little bit about the end product. What does that look like? We're going to go into a lot more detail about this, but when the commission is all done, as I said earlier, in most cases, what we're dealing with is a real world impact on the utility system and the communities it serves. For example, in a raid case, which we'll talk about quite a bit, a utility can't make a change to its rates, significant change to its rates without commission approval and review in a contested case and essentially a trial like proceeding. And so what will happen is a utility will propose a major change or someone else propose a major change. The commission will review that major change, and then the commission will issue a decision after a process and that's implemented in rates. And all the folks that I talked about earlier are a part of that process. All right, well, I'm going to pause here. That's the real high level background on who the commission is and why the commission exists. And before we move on to the next part of the training today and the presentation, I want to make sure you have the opportunity to ask any questions about those, that high level topic or if you have any thoughts you'd like to share. Okay. Not hearing any. You know, Candace, I just want to confirm people can raise their hands, is that correct? Yes, they should be able to. Okay. Okay, great. Oh, and someone did great. I promised I wasn't fishing for a raised hand. I just wanted to make sure you could. So, Heidi Hegegleler, I hope I pronounced your name correctly. Heidi, you can. You're unmuted, but I can't hear you. You might want to check your microphone and make sure it's working properly. Okay, I will later.",

        "text": "? The current rule has the 20 kw limit. Okay. Does that answer your question? Yes, this is for, okay. Yeah, this is for tier one. Got it. Thank you all'look. At the red line. Oay all right, I think we can move on to tier two, Pat. Al right, so first we made ire Recq, had revised the eligibility criteria to incorporate a table that looked similar to, although not identical to, the FERC SgIB. And we are fine, I think, with having this table as long as it applies to inverter based ders. So we revise the rule to make that distinction clear. And then our proposal for non inverter based ders is to maintain the current rulural language, which is two megawatt limit. I think, you know, we had had some concerns in the past with various aspects of the table, and one of those was that it's likely going to let a lot of people go through tier two who are not going to end up passing the screens. We concerned that that was going to lead to disputes and hard feelings. But so we want to be clear that we still have that concern, but we're nevertheless willing to make this change. So thank you, Jordan and the utilities for doing that. Iric believes that's the right move to, you know, the higher numbers in the table because again, the eligibility threshold should be set for kind of the highest conceivable project that would pass the screen. And I think I agree that a lot of projects towards the higher end might not pass, but they should at least have the opportunity to try and then get the benefit of that quicker interconnection in the event that they do pass. With regard to using it only for inverter based Ders versus rotating machines, my guess is that Oregon, like many other states, does not see many rotating machines as Ders. It's pretty rare. Most are inverter based. So I don't think this is worth a ton of our limited time at this workshop, but I would observe that the irric knows from participating in the discussions that originally set that table and the two megawatt limit at FERC that the two megawatt limit extending to rotating machines was set a little arbitrarily and not based on data like the table was. But that being said, that arbitrary negotiated limit did end up in the FERC rules. And because I think it will see extremely limited usage, I'm just going to stop right there and not say anything more about it. Yeah, I guess I'll just say I agree yogi. It's probably not worth spending much time debating. I think we'll be open to considering something other than 2 MW if there's something that's less arbitrary. But I think the key point is that we're not comfortable applying that table to non inverter based DER. So keeping what's in the current rules, the two megawatt limit and what's in the FERC rules seems like a good default, especially given that it's probably not going to proably not going to have a lot of use. So I won't go repeat what we already talked about on the substation transformer, back feed screen, penetration screen, single phase, shared secondary. I think those screens are exactly the same and we are, we have the same recommendations, or lack thereof, as we did in tier one. So I'll move on to the line configuration screen. This is an area where I very quickly get out of my technical depth, but I rec. I propose a table different ways. I think that you could find effective grounding. Someone will correct me if I've got that wrong. And the third row of the table allowed customers to interconnect just based, like without looking at grounding, just based on sort of the penetration percentages, I think, and that we were not comfortable with, with that aspect of it. So we proposed retaining the existing rule language and to a point that Yoki made earlier. If someone failed only this screen, for this reason, we could still take a closer look at the transformer configuration and approve it under the. I don't remember the exact section, but under the rule language that allows that gives us that discretion. So we think that is probably the right way to handle it. I invite any of the engineers to describe that better than I did. I'd like to toss in a couple of thoughts on this. This is having to do with effective grounding. And I've run into a lot of cases where the concept of effective grounding is very confusing and gets mixed in with safety grounding or earthing. And as a result of that, that, and if you go back and research the history behind this, a lot of this was based on analysis of large machines from 50 to 80 years ago, to be honest, is the critical thing is to evaluate overvoltage conditions during ground fault conditions. And to me I would rather see the whole concept of requiring effective grounding and all the weird calculations that people use",

        "text": " date, and we can. We'll make it a minimum requirement that a project have a CoD within the action. What's that called? The action window. Action plan, yeah, plan window. Thank you. But then PTE is saying, but we will still, assuming that we have a 2026 capacity need, we will still prioritize projects with the 2025 end of year cod. And I just was wondering if we could unpack that word, prioritize a little bit more and describe, what does that mean? Do we prioritize them at any cost, or is there some balancing that's done between cost and cod at that point? And how will we know that projects, you know, how will they feel like they're being treated fairly? Let's say they have a cod of midway through 2026, and yet they're the cheapest project by far. Is there some kind of an analysis that would be done to figure out, okay, did we go with that project, or is it, in fact, like a minimum requirement, and the first tranche of acquisitions will be the ones that are done by end of 2025, and then everyone else will get consideration after that. How do you view that? Yeah, really good question. So the. The intent there was for us to really signal that in 2026, we view a likely capacity need across all seasons. So if there were projects that could come online kind of January 1, 2026, we wanted those to bid in, and I think that we would likely analyze those, you know, as kind of meeting that capacity product bucket. I think that, from a preference perspective, know, we would take a look at how they perform against other types of resources as well as part of the portfolio sensitivity process. But really, the intent there was, you know, just a signal that if there are projects that can meet that COD, those are the ones that we are extremely interested in. But one of the feedback items that we did here in our stakeholder workshops is that those will be very challenging. And, you know, it's kind of an open question for us whether bidders will be able to meet that. And we've been encouraged to be pretty nimble on that as well and to think about how even if a project is not able to meet that 2025 CoD, you know, if we don't have sufficient volume to fill it, to look at projects that might come online midway through 2026, as you know, the commissioner Thompson or kind of the next, the next most expedient project that could help us close that capacity need. So I think that we are planning to, you know, look at those as two distinct product types, but also happy to as part of the portfolio analysis and portfolio sensitivity process to show kind of how those align and whether there are any differences in things like pricing or whether those are pretty consistent from what we're seeing in a better response view point. So is it fair to say then you're trying to reserve some, you're hoping to reserve some discretion to make what feels like a good call when it comes to prioritizing those that have a cod of 2025, it won't necessarily be a bright line that you'll probably consider some price factors as well if some of those projects that past that deadline. Yes, exactly right. Thank you. Go. I follow up on that. Yes, thank you. Thank you, chair. It strikes me that I think I'm realizing you're articulating two different products in part because we've moved away from having any non price. And so to really prioritize this sor of early need and this reality about how constrained the grid is sor of have two products, because if you just rank everything by price, youre going to have dates all over the map. And so were sort of in this. Is this an outfall of sort trying to move away from non price but still keep our date? The fact that youve got some preferences or some differentiating needs around dates that are hard to articulate in any kind of firm and fast way, I think that's fair. I think that maybe Im'viewing that as a little bit more of an output. I think that as we are kind of grappling with that and deciding how that should work, you know, it'it's, also a bit of a function of us responding to an IRP action plan that looks different than it has in the past. Right. And in kind of near recent irps, it said something like, you know, PGE has a capacity need on this date, and we'll procure this volume. And that's kind of been it from a resource perspective. And this is a little bit more complex. And that there is kind of that near term need, very near term need. And then there are mid to longer term things that we should do as we work toward a longer term target. So I think that we are exactly kind of what you're noting, Commissioner",

        "text": " meet climate targets and ensure we can continue to thrive here in Oregon, we need to stop expanding the gas system and begin to dismantle it. And this is because of the simple reason that there is no viable method to decarbonize the gas system. So the more we build, the bigger the problems we will be in the future. This means ending line extension allowances and subsidies for new gas connections and carefully scrutinizing any gas infrastructure investments. Since these assets are certain to become stranded assets as we shift our energy away from fossil fuels, northwest natural should be required to invest in electrication and thermal energy systems rather than continuing to promote its business model, which is although it's worked for many years in the past, as we've heard from the developers, it's out of sync with the future needs of Oregonians and even today's needs of Oregonians. Electrication has been widely researched and supported by energy policy analysts as the most cost effective decarbonization solution for nearly every sector of our economy, and certainly for housing and homes. Many home developers are already building all electric because this creates a high performing home with lower, much lower operating expenses. The developers, many of the developers testifying tonight have reinforced this fact that building homes all electric from the start is lower cost. So the idea that ending these line extension allowances somehow makes homes more expensive is just completely not true. If these home builders really want air polluting and carbon polluting gas appliances in the homes they build, they should not be subsidized to lower the cost for gas hookups and appliances. Where do those subsidies come from? They come from Rayairirs hub and others have shown that these subsidies will not be recovered in the future. Please reject Northwest Natural's proposal to increase its rateair funded subsidies for new gas connections and instead directed to end these subsidies, which are not aligned with rateair financial interests and Oregon climate goals. Please build on the clear direction that you gave in Northwest Natural's integrated resource plan to appropriately consider and incorporate electrification into the utilities decarbonization strategy. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, next on the list, I see Bethany Cotton. Good evening. For the record, my name is Bethany Cotton. B e t h a n y. Cotton. Like the fabric. C o t t o n. Chair Decker and commissioners Tanya Perkins. Thank you for the opportunity to comment. I am a resident of Eugene and unfortunately a northwest natural rapairer. I ask that you deny northwest natural's proposal. As a ratepeayer, I do not want my dollars to further subsidize new hookups that wed us to a fossil fuel proven toxic to our health and climate, creating more expense in the coming years when we inevitably electrify the grid. As an environmental lawyer and an antune to two kiddos under three, I'm deeply concerned about Northwest Natural's concerted efforts to undermine necessary climate policies at the local, state, and federal levels. I'm likewise concerned about the public health impacts of gas. I'm working to electrify my 111 year old home, an expensive process because of the sunk cost in the gas appliances in my home when I purchased it, and the total lack of incentives to improve efficiency via weatherization or electrification. Available via Northwest Natural. Of note, despite contrary claims, the gas furnace in my home did not provide resiliency during the ice storm, and my new EweB subsidized heat pump hot water heater is far more efficient than my gas hot water heater ever was. In August, during a required test, a northwest natural contractor discovered my meter was slowly leaking gas on the side of my home by my kitchen window. When asked when the company would come to fix the leak, he shrugged. Inside a week or six months. Six months passed. Then I received a letter saying they would come to replace or repair the meter in March. March passed with no visit. It took multiple calls and emails, during one of which the northwest natural staffer told me my work had been pushed to 2025 and during all of which my concerns were dismissed. Then two missed appointments with no communication before the company fixed what turned out to be two leaks eight months in during the same week, a four foot saw blade from a northwest natural contractor flew across the parking lot in Eugene, nearly hitting a man and embedding into a small business's wall. This is the company asking you to allow it to charge me more to sell its dangerous product to new customers. To increase its profits, Northwest Natural needs to focus on ensuring its current infrastructure is safe for users and prioritize adopting actually proven techniques to meet long standing climate requirements. Please order Northwest Natural to end rateayer subsidies for new hookups entirely and build on the clear direction you gave in Northwest Natural's IRP to ensure its decarbonization strategy incorporates electrification. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, and the next person I see on the list is another of the Christr",

        "text": " it is a snapshot? It's the snapshot for 2026 as a tuned VLCC value. Okay. And your, your proposal is that you would evolve to the view over the, over the planning horizon by the fall, or you would at least engage with staff on how you might do that as you work on the 2026. Avoid a cost. That's right. We stand by our commitments made in LC 80 to work with staff to update the methodology and the language staff quotes from our LCD comments where we acknowledge that there's two dynamics that have become more prominent in the IRP, including the decreasing capacity contribution of the marginal resource over the planning horizon. We stand by that. Just flagging that it's more complicated and that the value that we submitted initially before our corrected value shouldn't be taken to be the answer to that methodology. So that's why we recommend sticking with the single year snapshot value for this current cycle. Okay, thank you. I mean, I hear you sort of saying like we'll move to this, but there's complexity and sort of how it works, how the new way of doing it, it works. What is the practical impact for you? Irt of understand the desire to have things be more methodologically rigorous or correct or whatever. But it helped me understand any other reasons that you might have for your point of view that we should change staff'recommending, thanks Chairad Decr I think the primary view is as I and I'll acknowledge I'm not the technical expert here, but the need to have it be based on the marginal resource in the planning horizon is important to make sure that the methodology appropriately captures the effects of the CEP on emissions and transmission needs. Like in the context of those LCD comments. That's what we believe needs to be captured, and an average LCC of a single resource type over the planning horizon doesn't capture that. So the update we did on April 9 truly was a correction to a number that we didn't intend to file that was in error, and so that's the basis for this comment. All right, thanks. Any other questions for Sam? Okay, let's move on to our next public comment from Jake Stevens with new sun energy morning chair decker, commissioners Tawy and Perkins. Jake Stevens for the record for nuan energy I guess I'll start by saying, as I'm gathering from some other folks real time, I'm not sure that a lot of stakeholders that are affected by the implications of this docket. I've been really aware that it even exists, or that avoided cost methodology and a lot of related matters are being dealt with here. So so as we've joined for the matter later on the PGERFP front, we've been monitoring in real time, but a number of things jump out as we attempt to follow staff's report and presentation and the comments on this that are concerning and don't really appear to have been substantively addressed or vetted relative to the implications here and elsewhere. And I guess I'll start with an issue I brought up on the 1728 docket a few weeks ago, but this presumption that a four hour battery is the appropriate resource. While we appreciate that a clean resource is likely the right reference point for capacity costs in the future, we're struggling to see where and based on what evidentiary record or like appropriate discussion in analysis that the four hour battery has been settled on. Because there's huge consequences to that cost structure. And as a basic example of that, you know, does a winter cold snap that defines the winter peak for PGE only lasts 4 hours? You know, is that an eight hour event, a twelve hour event? How should we be modeling and looking at that as a basis for this pretty significant input? Similarly, energy efficiency, as we're looking at what it might avoid, has the potential to wholly or nearly wholly displace these peak events. As those reductions in load relative to heating or cooling or sort of spread around the system. So how many future batteries of what peaking capacity we need or how much future transmission we need interact with that as well as with the scale of the battery. So the math related to a 27% contribution or the numbers that were sort of batted around seem a bit counterintuitive. And again, not sure where and how all of the pieces of that have been fully vetted. We're also looking at this staff report and again, trying to follow all this. But we see these market price forward curves that have been the basis of a lot of PUC matters as we look at the resources effectively. If I'm reading this and understanding correctly, staff recommending against using the curve that the market views as the energy price because it's too high. Like, I don't really understand that logic. And I don't understand how that's sort of being flushed out and properly analyzed in terms of what it avoids or how we're thinking about all kinds of resources, including effectively, this chart here. Figure one on page six of the report essentially highlights this. Tens if",

        "text": " were to take another, you know, rent and demonstrating this as a real concern for customers, you know, they should analyze the real cost of a credit rating downgrade. How much debt does that apply to? What is the actual cost of that then? And then spread that over some number of ppas. That's reflective of the type of leverage that would be required to actually cause a credit downgrade. Whereas I think here they've proposed, you know, the mitigation being issuing equity every time they enter into a PPA to match, that seems like a very expensive remedy or mitigation. And so I feel like it's also a bit of an overreach. The last thing I will agree with Idaho power on is I think if we only take this issue up in rate cases, we're getting at a totally different issue, which is cost recovery for this issue, whereas Idaho power is raising it now and in a context to say, let's prevent the cost from ever hitting customers in the first place. So I think they're right to raise it here if they really want to protect customers. But for all the reasons I just discussed and not really convinced that this is worth acting on. Okay. Thanks for those thoughts. So I think that there's a pretty clear consensus on how we'll handle this. I don't think that we've really, I don't think that, frankly, we have time today to talk through all of the other things. I think what will be most beneficial here is if I don't see a lot of space between the parties overall and the ie on some of these other things, I think if there is a sort of mutual inclination to work this out and get it moving faster, working with staff even later this week, rather than sort of filing rounds of comments and things like that, and getting toward a staff proposal that can be presented promptly, I think is a good idea. I'm not going to sit here and try to dictate exactly what those times and dates are, except to express the willingness, or my willingness to help the parties find a date that the commission can kind take this up and take final action on it that is not necessarily bound by the every other week, Tuesday morning schedule a of our regular public meetings. So I think with that, we'll defer action on this item and take a five minute break and reconvene at 1110. Thanks. Thank you, commissioners. Thank you. Chair Decker all right, we are back in session and we will continue our regular public meeting with our next complicated and contentious item on today's agenda, which is docket number um 2000, which is the proposal to establish an interim solar plus storage avoid cost rate. Good morning Ryan. For PUC staff. Morning, chair decker, Commissioner Tania and commissioner Thompson. For the record, my name is Ryan Bain. I'm an analyst in the OPUC. I'm joined today by staff manager Scott Gibbons and staff counsel Stephanie Andrews. I am here to discuss UM 2000 and to introduce staff's proposal for an interim solar plus storage standard avoid cost rate in the current phase of staffs investigation. For background uM 2000 was open several years ago to address a range of issues relating to contracting, interconnection and compensation of QFs under Purpa. Last fall, we initiated a process to address the final remaining issues related to planning and avoided cost rate calculation. Through that open scoping process, we heard from QF parties that the most impactful thing we could do would be to establish an interim solar plus storage standard avoid cost rate as soon as possible. In response, staff initiated an expedited process consisting of several rounds of comments, workshops and discussions with stakeholders to establish the interim rate. At the conclusion of this process, staff came to the recommendations outlined in attachment one to today's regular agend item, too. SaaS's proposal for an interim solar plus storage rate relies on the existing methodology for the standalone solar rate with several key changes required to capture the added capacity value by the inclusion of storage. With regard to standard rate eligibility, three megawatt limit on total project capacity will remain with the addendum that the storage resource may range from 25% to 100% of the capacity of the generating solar resource and that the storage resource may have between two to 4 hours of duration. Proxy QF resource used to estimate the capacity value of solar plus storage resources will be 3 mw in solar capacity with a three megawatt battery of four hour duration capacity payments on the interim rate will be reduced to four premium peak hours per day identified by each utility based on a given month loss of load probability. These premium peak hours are designed to signal the most valuable hours for dispatch of stored QF energy in alignment with utility needs, just as the modeled proxy resour is assumed to dispatch whenever possible during these premium peak hours. Because this is a new, somewhat experimental rate, staff is proposing a 50 megawatt threshold per utility at which the commission will review",

        "text": ". You don't have to do some other things, but it's, there will be industrial solar. But can we incentivize development that doesn't place more stressors on the hydro system transmission system in California? The California PUC, as you probably aware, adopted a tariff strategy that incentivizes storage behind the meter. We think that will take the peakiness out of their system. Would it help take the peakiness out of our northwest energy system? We think the answer is yes. We hope to test that with the Pleexos NrEL modeling systems that we were working on. And it, its probably, they had their reasons for doing it'probably, good for the northwest, too. And maybe with that, I'll hand it back to you, Ed, so we can, well, maybe we've covered everything here except, well, on site solar systems may be worth an extra mention. What we found is we started looking at some of the plans is just tens of thousands of acres being evaluated for new solar systems, and a lot of it onor near tribal land. And so one of the focuses in the energy vision is let's also look at putting solar systems on existing structures. So on site solar has certain advantages, less disruptive to the land, also much closer to the load. And there are probably some things that the Oregon public utility commission could do to help make more on site solar possible and economic. And again, happy to answer questions or discuss any of these things, but if not right now, we'll go to the next slide. The Oregon Public Utility Commission is got a unique role with the Energy Trust of Oregon. So we focused a lot in the development of the council's power plan, most recent power plan, urging them to increase their conservation targets because of the benefits we saw both for consumers and for fish and wildlife. Seems like that's something you could continue to do or urge for the energy trust of Oregon and to monitor the implementation of those programs to ensure that they're meeting aggressive targets. We in the energy vision, set some ambitious goals for weatherizing tribal homes and businesses and also testing solar panels and battery systems to provide zero net energy for those tribal homes and businesses. Again, that's something that the energy trust of Oregon could do and something you may want to consider as you work with them. We also set ambitious goals to weatherize and achieve net zero energy for all low income homes by 2035. And also recommendations for utilities and the Northwest Energy Efficiency alliance and other organizations to implement comprehensive programs to improveve energy management practices in the commercial and industrial sector. Rob, I think now I turn it over to you. Yeah, just. And I think I may turn it back to you quickly, Ed. But. So there are recommendations embedded in the energy vision. This is. It merits continuous emphasis that energy efficiency and conservation programs are fish friendly. We just, everything we look at comes back to these as kind of the first resources in the resource stack of fish friendly resources. And so section 3.4 of the energy vision addresses energy vision. And it has. Might need the next slide. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, the next slide. It has these subsections. And embedded within the subsections are the individual recommendations that ED was talking about or that we've all been talking about. And the recommendations have this context in the energy vision. And we struggled with how do we best present this information to the reader and to various groups and drew out emphasis, but we don't want to loot emphasis on recommendations, but we don't want to lose the context of the work that describes why it's important to expand low income weatherization programs. What kind of energy management practices in commercial and industrial facilities are, seem to be at the leading edge of best practices in the building environment. And we've recently come to find that there are leading engineering firms in the northwest that are helping the building industries innovate with energy conservation measures. And we were very excited to have a conversation, for instance, with PA engineering and find that so much alignment between our vision and what their, their working model is. So let's go to the next slide and again back to this notion that reducing peak demand is a solution. So the, there are a number of ways to, to reduce peak demand. Think energy efficiency is very promising. Pricing structures also promising demand response and load management and increasing electricity storage. One of our member tribes, the Aka nation, is taking a hard look at advanced rail energy storage. I think they're interested in prototyping that it doesn't have the same problems that pump storage has, which can badly affect tribal for foods and other resources. There's a project up by Goldendale that is fiercely opposed by the accation and I think there are better options out there and we need to look at those. So I'll pause there and maybe we should go, actually, let's go to the next slide. So recommendations for the pucs, these are taken from the energy vision",

So I don't have any particular questions for you here today, Mandy. I want to appreciate the business office, which has undergone a transition in both the chief operating officer and the chief financial officer for continuing just a high level of work with a lot of accountability and integrity in the work that you folks are doing. Thanks to you and your staff. And with that, Commissioner Ant Tani'be prepared to support motion. Well, first of all, echo your thanks to the staff. Don't see very often in this forum. Hey, Commissioner Tawi, we're only catching like every few words. You'saying. That any better? So far so goode. Okay. All right. So just echoing the thanks. Really appreciate how much hard work the business services in to keeping the trains running on time so that the rest of the agency can do the subject matter work that is so critical, able to manage without underpinning so thanks so much. I'm comfortable with this. I'm also familiar with the budget and so I we adopt the motion outline in the memo. I concur. The motion carries and the annual fee assessment rate is set. More to come, I know, as we work toward developing the budget for the next biennium. But for now, thank you very much and have a good day. Thank you. You as well. Oay the next item on our regular agenda today is Idaho Powers RFP docket number um 2255, and we'll invite Kim Herb up for PUC staff to discuss staff's recommendation in this matter. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay, great. Good afternoon, chair decker and commissioner Tani. For the record, my name is Kim Herb and I am the utility strategy and planning manager representing staff today. And with me is staff council Joanna Remagenider as well as Len Trinidad, who's representing London Economics International, the independentaluator for this docket, Idaho Power is seeking acknowledgement of its 2026 RFP final shortlist to meet 2026 and 2027 capacity needs, deficits identified, and its acknowledged 2021 integrated resource plan, but as adjusted to reflect updated understanding the need and to interim procurement efforts in the RFP. The company sought bids for combination of capacity and energy resources to provide a minimum of approximately 350 peak capacity and up to 1100 variable energy resources. Products to meet the needs included both resource based products such as wind, solar and battery energy storage and form energy market purchases that met the eligibility requirements of the Western Resource Adequacy program. Idaho Power'final shortlist includes projects with the possible total nameplate capacity of 2730 mutually exclusive projects. While this is more than double the volume described in the RFP, staff and ie agree with the company that the final shortlist appears to provide diverse operational characteristics sufficient to meet the company's 2026 and 2027 needs, but with room for contingencies. Staff finds that the final shortlist was arrived at in a manner consistent with the competitive bidding rul. The company followed the guidelines and its development of the draft RP on the scoring and modeling methodology and in this case included a waiver requ to allow for the review of the scoring and modeling methodology at the same time as the review of the draft RFP. The IE found that the draft that the RFP process was run in accordance with the rules laid out in the RFP document and reflected the commission's conditions. Bidders were treated fairly under the rules of the RFP Idaho power price, SoR, Edho powers, price and non price scoring were reasonable and that offers selected for the final shortlist were selected fairly and transparently. Staff is supported while acknowledging the final shortlist, but recommends two conditions to address stakeholder and staff concerns about the identified needs, benchmarking utility owned resource risks and contract negotiations as the competitive bidding rules explained and our FE should address that identified need and an acknowledged acknowledged IRP or a need that subsequently identified or that addresses a change in circumstances with demonstrated good cause. A final shortlist acknowledgement request must address the consistency between that final shortlist and the last acknowledged IRP and as explained on the staff report, Idaho Power updated its need multiple times over the course of the RFP and there were some disconnect between the need reference and that use to determine the final shortlist. Staff recognizes that this is a challenge inherent to the rapid patient procurement at this time and appreciates the company's efforts. He use the best information available at the time, but staff also wanted to preserve some alignment between vetted planning processes such as irps and procurement decisions. Additionally, staff was concerned about the company's use of the term minimum to describe the volume of capacity it was seeking in this RFP, as it could be interpreted as staff supporting a limitless volume for the cond commission supporting limited volume. While the company said it will only procure",

        "text": " Administrative Procedure act. Under that chapter 183, those laws do allow for a hearing process with contested cases, and that includes if there's suspension or rights or privileges at stake. So we do believe that under the APA, we do have a right for the hearing if there are still some concerns about where that authority might exist. But I want to go on and say that even beyond that, Cubs'motion to dismiss should be denied based off of the facts and also for policy reasons. Now, Chair Dugar, you pointed out that when there is a motion to dismiss, the commission should assume all facts in our direct testimony pleadings. Now, we did indicate, for instance, in exhibit 200 on page four of our testimony, that without the requested rate change, PG's Roe in 2025 for consideration of the constable and cide battery projects would be only approximately 5.29%, significantly lower than the authorized ROE of 9.5 that we have currently. As you've indicated, you're well aware, we have had increases in inflation, increases in demand, cost incursions, and when we're looking at our 2025 general rate case, which involves new projects, new plan and conditions that will be used and useful in 2025, these were items that could not have been included in the prior rate case, UE 416. Now, of the requests that we are seeking currently for 2025, approximately 75% of those cost recovery relates to capital projects that will benefit customers. 25% is to O and M. And as we've indicated, it's for increasing expenses such as insurance, which is also pointed out in our testimony. Now, I know that Cub has indicated that they think that we are rel litigating issues from the prior rate case uv 416 decuckkeer, can you talk to me about this rel litigation concept and whether you're understanding whether or not, from a legal perspective, a stipulation that is silent as to the duration of the commitments that the parties make has some sort of legally implied duration? Is there anything legally to support the idea that cubs raising that a stipulation, an agreement to settle certain issues in a certain way sort of extends beyond the rates that are set by that case? Chair? Not to my knowledge, unless it's a specific term in the stipulation. That's typically not what has occurred. If you looked at the 6th stipulation, for instance, that deals with our policy proposal and the tariff language concerning the renewable automatic adjustment clause, that stipulation said that we would withdraw that request from the UE 416 proceeding. We never indicated that we would never bring this proposal back or request consideration of this inclusion in the tariff of standalone energy storage at the transmission level. So I think that Cub is mischaracterizing the commission's well established rate review process and the commission's authority and how they've treated settlements. You're always going to have Roe, you're always going to have on M, you're always going to have capital projects. The issues will always be the same. It's the facts that will change. The 2024 rate case dealt with the 2024 test year. What we have before us right now involves in UE 435 is for new plant, new additions and new costs that will be needed beginning in 2025 for new plant that will be serving customers in 2025. Now I know that Cubb did request. We have another question there. Yeah. So you said the stipulation. Well, it doesn't say that it will go on forever. I'd like to hear you address Cub's obvious frustration that it is coming back in a very quick interval. And it's not like it's been several years. It's been a short period of time. And so that's a fair amount of the frustration coming from Cub. Seems to be that short duration from last. Well, from the stipulation, yes. Thank you, Commissioner Perkins, for that point. Commissioner Tanei pointed out that rightly the Citizens Utility Board has been an active and sophisticated and very competent party for many years and if not decades, in proceedings involving rate cases before the commission. So they should be aware of this as well. It used to be that we had rate cases on an almost annual basis. If you looked at it between 2014 through 2019, I think other than one year, we were having annual rate cases that went to affect the January of every year. I think what distinguishes this is we had settlements in those cases. Coub participated and signed those settlements, and Cub never brought up any arguments about this is back to back. You shouldn't be allowed to do this. But at that time, what is of interest is that we were seeing interest rates decline. We were seeing the Roe that we requested be issued through settlements or approval from the commission at a lower level. If you look at what the cost drivers have been, and they have been significant, over half of the",

The general contractor, electrical subcontractor and the city of Tiger don't understand at this point PGE's decision, nor the timeframe that we've incurred to have these plans clarified and the refusal to re energize our building. Building the property was an operating rental community for more than 50 years prior to the start of our remodeling. We share the goal of bringing about a good remodeling and a safe place for residents to live. We just don't understand how more than a decade of deferred maintenance and local building code violations which were on record with the city of Tiger left PGE to not intervene until months into the renovation that started in the summer of 2022. Thank you. Thank you for your comment and raising this to the commission's attention. Of course, staff representatives from our consumer services division will be able to follow up and have received your email. Thank you. Terrific. And we appreciate that very much. Okay. Is there anyone else that would like to make a general public comment? Okay. Not hearing anyone will go to the consent agenda. Thanks. Good morning, chair. I would move that we adopt the staff recommendations as set forth. Each, each memo on each item that's on the consent agenda today. Good morning. This is Commissioner Tanei, and I second that. I concur. The motion carries and the consent agenda is adopted. And I thank, as I know we all do, all of the staff, people that worked on the issues presented there. Okay, we'll go right in then, to our rulemaking agenda. Leon Grumbo from POUC staff will be presenting AR 656, which is requesting approval to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking related to the National Electric Safety code. Good morning. Hey, good morning. Can you hear me? Yeah, we can hear you. All right. Hey, good morning. Chair Decker, Commissioner Thompson and commissionertony, for the record, my name is Leon Grumbo. I'm the electric safety program manager in the safety, Reliability and security division. I am here joined today with support of this agenda item by Heidi Caswell, safety Administrator, as well as Chris Alwine, assigned Alj. I'm here today to present to you rulemaking number one, listed in today's agenda, which was docketed as AR 656, a rulemaking docket to address the fact that the National Electric Safety Code, the NESC, has a new version titled c 220 23 from the previous adopted c 220 17 version. It was adopted and approved by the American National Standard Board on April 25 of 2022, published August 1 of 2022, and became effective nationally February 1 of 2023 within the 180 days of his publication. I'm here to request to the commission to appro to approve initiating a former rulemaking proceeding to adopt this new version. The Oregon PUC has decades of history using the NESC to ensure electric and communication operators are constructing, operating, and maintaining in a safe, efficient manner to the benefit of all Oregonians. As a matter of history, the OPC adopted several sections of the NESC in January of 1923. In 1973, the OPUC began adopting the entire NESC code. Since the first adoption, the OPUC staff has been conducting its safety mission across the state, enforcing Anya code and the Oregon administrative rules for electric and communication operators throughout history of the co continues to evolve as it recognizes new challenges that exist in electric and communication infrastructure. Typically, the code is updated and republished on a five year cycle, but because of the impact of COVID it was published out an additional year fall of 2022. OPUC staff performed a side by side comparison of the 2017 and the 2023 editions and found limited changes. Some of the changes from 2017 to 2023 include content for battery storage and pv generation stations, as well as marking of anchor guides to consider what kind of impacts the code would have to operators within the state staff scheduled and conducted in an informal workshop on January 17, 2023 to evaluate impacts to utility operators. Impacts were considered to be minor, with no operator objecting to this adoption. If approved for formal rulemaking, the notice would be posted in the state bulletin on April 1, 2023. Comment period would close April 2024 or April 24, 2023, and therefore it would be brought forward to the administrative hearings division for adoption May 2023. This concludes my presentation. However, I am available for any questions that you might have. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your time. Strikes me as a straightforward date update looking at the rules, and I'm",

        "text": " of the company's non wire solution pilot proposal, and this is an opportunity for future improvement. The plan does demonstrate the capability to analyze and implement non wire solutions. Indeed, the company developed and pursued a non wire solution for transformer need in the substation serving the waser area. This non wire solution, a battery energy storage solution, is currently in progress and will be Idaho Power's first distributed storage system. Further, the plan identified a second nonwire solution opportunity at a substation in the genura area, which will be a future exploration as the grid need is not forecast until 2028. Staff looks forward to following progress on the wiser project as well as further analysis of the Junoura opportunity. Next slide please. Turning to stakeholder feedback, I'd like to thank these two groups for commenting October on the Idaho power plan. They provided over 20 specific comments and similarly to the other two utilities, comments were generally positive and provided constructive feedback. As was the case earlier, there'be an opportunity for those stakeholders to say more if they choose next slide, please. With respect to next steps, I'll simply note they are the same as in my preceding presentation of for civific power and prior for Portland general electric staff'intent. Is that the next steps will apply across utilities and across the plans. One final slide advance, please. I'd like to just complete my remarks there. Thank you very much. And again, I'm available to answer questions as you deliberate on Idaho Powers plan. Thank you, Nick. Idaho Powers planning seems both very direct and concrete and positive from that perspective, and maybe appropriately smaller scoped in some way. Maybe smaller scoped in a way that's appropriate to the service territory that they have in Oregon relative to their total service territory. My question is, I guess, does that balance seem appropriate to you? And we discussed issues that need to come forward and be discussed around the refinement of the DSP guidelines. Are those conversations going to be relevant and meaningful to this plan as they are to the other two, respecting the differences that exist? Thanks for your question, Che Decker. The first part is, I do believe the plan is appropriately scaled, as you noted, and the second part is how I ll paraphrasing how might revisions reflect that guideline revisions reflect that moving forward? I think there's two important parts to consider there. One is how DSP guidelines may need to be revised to reflect clean energy planning requirements, and the fact that those are applicable to PGE and Pacific Corete would not be applicable for Idaho power. And yet, ID hope Power also has its own clean energy goals with a different timef frme perhaps, and different stair steps in terms of reductions and such. But those clean energy goals will necessitate similar action, presumably on their grid as it will on the PGE and specific power grid. So I do think that there's an art there, threading a needle, if you will, of not getting bound up in clean energy plan requirements that are not applicable Toaho Power, but yet provide the incentives and the opportunities for them to plan for a similar low carbon, no carbon future. I know Idaho Power in the past noted expressed interest in a different cadence depending on the outcomes of their, sorry, I should say, a different planning cadence for DSP depending on what this first review showed. And so I suspect that they'll raise that issue again, although I shouldn't prejudice that perhaps they will. Perhaps not so. There's a number of, I only bring that up to note. There's a number of issues for us to consider specific to Idaho power moving forward in the revision process. Thank you. That's really helpful. And cadence is interesting question for really all of us consider with this planning effort, there's a lot of different, I don't know, outcomes, I guess, that are informed and influenced by this planning effort and, and understanding where those outcomes may differ across utilities may be relevant to cadence. So I hear you saying you don't have a requirement to have a clean energy plan every two years, and this is more relevant to the cost benefit analysis in your rate cases. You know, maybe, maybe there's, you know, some, some different ways of thinking about what the cadence is based on, what's being informed or influenced by the plan. Appreciate that commissioners. Other questions, comments, discussion points for Nick. I think you've covered them, or we've already covered them in the context of, with their two plans. I just add to your dialog you were just having, you know, Nick, I appreciate you bringing forward how Idaho power might, given their goals, be more interested in Ders and so on as they think about a zero carbon future. I think also about the resilience and climate addict ##ation questions that might raise challenges for that express themselves in DSP, either constraints and pressures on the hydro system or know weather extremes or wildfire or on and on. That might also come into play as you think about, again,",

And that's using star nine if you are calling by phone. Okay, Alison Williams, go ahead for Idaho Power. Good afternoon. Afternoon, commissioners. Can you hear me? Great. Thank you. For the record, my name is Allison Williams. I'm the energy policy and strategy advisor at Idaho Power. That is regulatory policy and strategy advisor. Thank you so much for the opportunity to be here. And a special thanks to staff. We found staff's recommendation to approve our plan reflective of the work that we put into the plan. We also thought that staff and party has identified a number of areas where there was rightful opportunity for improvement really had just a limited number of comments and response, and there are less areas of action and more just ongoing areas where we think conversation should be had within the DSP and DSP guidelines. The first would be our process and demonstration of community engagement. We've been straightforward in the past about. We obviously care very deeply about community engagement, but this is a struggle for us. In eastern Oregon. We put a lot of time into getting as much participation as possible into the two workshops that we had to inform our part two. And the feedback that we received was consistent with the feedback we have received in this case, as well as a number of others, which is that cost is a concern. And we took that as the primary takeaway of the community needs, was to identify projects that are least cost, and we'll be mindful of that. I definitely agree that our plan can be better at documenting specifically that feedback that we heard. And so that's really low hanging fruit for us, is better documenting what we heard and how we are making that actionable within our grid needs identification and the pilot projects. But I think that also speaks to the second point I wanted to note, and that's that community engagement is especially difficult depending on the grid needs. The grid needs that we identified all were within our substations in very rural areas. And so the community impact, we'unsure how we assess what the impact is. This is not the same as a substation that's within a metropolitan area directly adjacent to apartment buildings and homes. And so that's something that we will continue to work on. But again, we just raise that this is a challenge for us, that it doesn't look the same as it does for others. That said, we want to make sure that we're demonstrating that the grid need will likely inform the depth of community engagement. We've had projects in the past in eastern Oregon that did and would have necessitated much more deep community engagement. For instance, if we had moved forward with a microgrid that would have existed in the Jordan Valley that did have a really large community engagement plan, and then circumstances changed in that area. And that particular solution didn't pencil out. The grid needs that we identified looking forward are very different from the Jordan Valley project. And we just note that that grid needs drive for us, grid needs drive. The type and the depth of community engagement. And then finally, speaking to the cadence issue that is an ongoing question for us is not just whether two years is the appropriate keys, but if not two years, how many with the desire to sync up DSP activity with IRP activity three years doesn't seem appropriate. We've thought about the potential for four years, which feels like a long time, and yet when we put our grid needs projects together, we did need to extend out six years to find a host of projects that would be appropriate to talk about. And so we already extended what would be three cycles of a DSP if we were on a two year cadence. Thank you for the opportunity to raise that. It is something that we're considering and as of now, I think we believe that a four year cadence would be most appropriate given the projects we have identified and that would help us align to our IRP. But we are open to discussions and would love to hear more conversation about",

        "text": " that the cost per kilowatt year is much different. So what I mean by that. So if we're thinking the four hour battery in 2026, it's going to have costs and benefits, but we believe in PG'IRP, that many for hour batteries will be built between now and, say, 2035, such that in 2035, you're going to have a bunch of four hour batteries already built. The next four hour battery is going to be much, much less effective at reducing our capacity need than the four hour battery you build in 2026. And so the value that you get from it is much lower, such that the cost per unit of capacity that you get out of that battery is much higher. So the capacity benefits of an avoided battery that you would assign to that energy efficiency, we think, should be different in 2026 than in this example, 2035. The 2035 value should be. The energy efficiency is simply much, much more valuable then. And so we think the IRP is a place where you can identify what is the marginal capacity resource that we're adding. Again, with some translation, this gets a. A little tricky to do, but we believe you can do it. And then you say, all right, well, that is the marginal generation resource. That is the cost of that capacity. That should be the thing that's applied, not what we're doing now, which is, oay, what's your cost of that four hour battery? In the near term? We just decide it was the four hour battery and just extrapolate that over the entire planning horizon, not incorporating changing resource costs so the cost up better and the performance. So that's the second part of this recommendation. And then you go to the third part. What I said before is the transmission deferral credit. We don't incorporate in energy efficiency methods this transmission expansion deferral. So what we say is that, okay, well, we've got this four hour battery. We've got whatever your marginal wind or solar resources that we're using in the near term, and that's it. But if you've been following along with our IRP, or probably anyone's IRP in the Pacific Northwest, transmission capacity is limited. And so, especially for PGE, so highly dependent on BPA's transmission system. And so the cost of adding another resource in 2026 is something. But the cost of adding a resource in, say, 2029 is much different because there is a finite amount of transmission capacity that we can get through BPA system, beyond which we have to do something about it. And that doing something about it costs a lot of money. And so the value then, of this energy efficiency that you would be considering adding is significantly higher once that transmission capacity is fully allocated. That time for context is relatively soon. And so we think it's important now to consider it. The means of which you consider it are relatively simple. So you can, with pges modeling apparatus, you can run the portfolio analysis twice, once with your transmission constraints and once without it. You can look at, ok, well, what are the differences in marginal generation resources, both for energy and capacity, and say, all right, well, the transmission constraints force you to move away from your ideal resource. Imagine there was some perfect resource not emitting, generating in all hours of the day, dispatchable in the gorge, for example. So we would, and incredibly cheap. So RRP is naive, but it's not that naive, right? It would select that resource as much as it could possibly get. Well, given limited transmission, we are going to be forced away from hypothetically that resource and go to something more expensive, less effective, yada yada. The difference in cost between those two resources should be the cost we think attributed to this transmission deferral that should go into your avo costs. We're thinking that, yeah, you can just run this portfolio analysis twice, check the marginal resources in both, take the differences in costs, and that's your transmission deferral credit. Again, there's some subjectivity in deciding which is the marginal resource. And looking at these transmission constraints, it is incumbent then that we have basically a full characterization of the existing transmission system. It also requires that we have a full characterization of all the transmission expansion options that are available to PGE. So if there was a bunch of availability on the system and we didn't have that in the IRP, well, then that's clearly going to give a incorrect market signal. But hopefully in the IRP we are doing this perfectly, or someone's telling us we're not. So that's transmission deferral credit, we think. Again, it's relatively simple execution would require some subjectivity and some nuance. But again, if the goal is to incorporate long term economics of the energy system into or avoing costs, we just don't see a way you can do that without considering",

        "text": " is. That's about what is, you know, a minimum achievable. It's about 1000 mw, can be built by 25. Not that you shouldn't consider dates longer than that. Thanks. Great, thank you. Okay, let's go to Irene Sanger. Thank you, chair Deckker. Good afternoon, Chair Decker, Commissioners Thompson and Tommy. I'm going to be quick on this issue. Appreciate the question that Mark Thompson asked about the impact of the later cods. That was a question that we had. Our ask to the company at this point is for them to provide more information about how projects with the different cods will be modeled and scored against each other. I think doing it after the bids are in, it is not sufficient in our mind, because bidders need to know how their projects will be scored, what the impact is, before they make particular proposals. They may be able to come online a little bit earlier. That's going to cost a lot. They want to understand how valuable coming online earlier is going to be to PGE. So our ask would be for PGE to provide some more information up front so bidders can incorporate that into their bids. This is a big paradigm change, and, I mean, what PG is proposing and then what you're proposing to go back to probably take quite a bit of time. I guess I'm just a little surprised because I feel like what we are usually hearing from Nipsey is a desire to minimize non price scoring. And here we are with no non price scoring. Commissioner Taney's honing in on the workaround that's created that has to exist as a result. And I hear you saying we should go back, no. Or not. Yeah, I must have totally misstated what I was trying to say, so I apologize. What we understand is that PGE is going to accept later cods and they're going to be valued lower than if somebody was able to meet their near term capacity need. So that's how we understand PG is going to frame the RFP. We're not opposed to that. We think that that's a reasonable way to go forward. If somebody chooses to deliver in 2027 rather than 2026 or 2025, then they're going to be. They're going to be evaluated differently by PGE later in the process. PGe said they're going to make some sort of determination. We would like to know how that flows through to how PGE is going to evaluate the projects and that we're not suggesting that there be a non price score in this. But if we have more information about, more transparency about how PGE is going to evaluate this, which they've said they're going to do, then somebody could adjust their price score to reflect when they're going to be delivering or they're not their price score, they could adjust the price that they're going to offer based on when they're planning to deliver. Well, so what if they don't know? So what if they would say, look, we're trying to sort of snap a line. At the end of 2025, we're going to look at that portfolio of bids first. We're going to take what seems reasonable from that first. And then everyone else is just going to be evaluated based on their price score in a second portfolio. I know that Jacob, when he was talking about that, modified that a little bit by starting to say, well, if it was halfway through 2026 and things like that, and maybe that's all you're talking about. But if that was the answer, that there's just kind of two evaluations and they can't really know until they know how much is in the first bucket. What kind of hit you take by being in the second bucket? I mean, how much? What? I guess I'm having a hard time knowing what it is they can tell you. That's helpful. If it really is that they don't know anything right now, then they might not be able to tell anymore. But our assumption is that they probably know a little bit more than the rest of us do about what they're going to do. And it would be good for them to provide all the information that they have now about how they expect to do this. And so people can evaluate that. That's all we're asking for. Okay, understood. Thanks. I just wanted to make sure there wasn't something more specific. Again, it sort of sounds like, obviously, I misread your first comments to be like, oh, we actually do want scoring. You just want all the information that exists. O yeah, that's right. Sorry for being confusing there. I know that we're running short on time. And I did want to note, if possible, at the end of the meeting or at any other time, I wanted to respond to PGE in the IE statements about the form contracts. We have a pretty different view on that. So it is possible. Why don't you go ahead and do that here since we talked with PG about",

        "text": ", it's a proven resource, saved consumers over $70 billion, and as far as we can tell, it's positive for fish and wildlife because these savings tend to provide the most savings during peak times, winter and summer. And they don't involve steel on the ground. They don't involve changes in river flows. They have positive effects for fish and wildlife. So it has that advantage as well. And then in terms of renewable resources, if they're in combination with batteries or other storage and electrical load management, they can create an environment that's better for fish and wildlife and tribal resources. So if we go to the next slide, please. A key theme is reducing peak loads to try to address the problems that we saw in that slide a few minutes ago that we spent time on. Peak loads hurt salmon and consumers. The peak loads kill salmon because of the big fluctuations in the river that we've talked about. And they also hurt consumers because they're often served by expensive resources and require additional transmission and distribution lines, which are expensive and affect tribal and other resources. So we lay out a number of proposals to reduce peak demands, including shifting the heating and cooling of buildings and water heating out of peak times. We'd like to talk to you about pricing transparency, where utilities and utility customers should provide clear price signals on the cost of serving peak loads. And we're also focused on smart charging, seeing a lot of develop a lot more electric cars on the road. And we think it's important that those cars charge during off peak periods. I have an electric car, and the easiest thing for me to do when I come home from work is to plug it in and charge it at a peak time. That's not very good for the system, not very good for salmon. So we need to set up incentives for charging during off peak periods. We go to the next slide. I think this, Rob, you and I guess we're going to do this clearly, with all the energy development we're talking about, it's important to do it in the right place. So, Rob, why don't you pick this up and I can help. Sure. A number of things here. And I had the pleasure of sitting in with the Washington energy facility site evaluation Council as they worked on their transmission corridor sighting. And we presented the energy vision to them and asked hard questions about, well, why, you know, why can this type of load be served with, you know, a resource that doesn't require new transmission and distribution lines? Questions like that. And to take, we urge them to take a regional look at the major transmission sighting problems facing the northwest because our transmission system is regional. And the county commissioners from Kittitasc county were sort of mystified about why I was speaking to these issues. But I think it slowly dawned on them that the system is interconnected. And as we were developing the plan and we had some interactions with the Nature Conservancy, they have a very extensive effort entitled Power of Place west, where they're looking at solar, wind, and transmission buildouts that are compatible with resources that their organization wants to protect. I encourage you to hear from the Nature Conservancy. We engaged american farmlands trust took an interest in our project. They wanted to protect high value farmlands, but they also were thinking about, is there a way to set aside lower value farmlands? And again, the key is siding in the right place. Can we siteite energy facilities that are in groundwater depletion zones and where some lower value agriculture could be retired and groundwater could be restored, and farmers or who would earn revenues from wind or solar operations? There's a lot of creative thinking going on out there. And so what does this have to do with the Oregon Public Utility Commission? Well, we also observe that in places like New York state and Massachusetts, the public utility commissions have incentivized citing that promotes sort of resource friendly outcomes that those states are interested in. You get priority in the resource act if you cite a resource that is pollinator friendly, and Massachusetts, of all things. And I was mystified by this. And I said, Pat, can this really be true? Can the PCs do this kind of stuff? And I was surprised that the PUCs have potential tools to incentivize good sighting decisions. So maybe with that, we've taken a hard look at the desirability of on site solar systems. They avoid transmission build outs, et cetera. You don't have to do some other things, but it's, there will be industrial solar. But can we incentivize development that doesn't place more stressors on the hydro system transmission system in California? The California PUC, as you probably aware, adopted a tariff strategy that incentivizes storage behind the meter. We think that will take the peakiness out of their system. Would it help take the peakiness out of our northwest energy system? We think the answer is yes. We hope to test",

        "text": " terms we were using between different rules in different sections. I I want to make sure I have an understanding of one more thing about this distinction, which is, do we need a, like, within the way the rules are written now, or within the way the rules should be written, and we, like, have an oversight? Like, do we need a definition that encompasses facility, like generator and interconnection facilities, or is it okay to just have us go back through the rules and anywhere that we might be using that in the rules itself? Just say whatever terms we use facility and interconnection facilities. Like, is that acceptable, or are we ruining some sort of policy by not having one rule that lumps them together? You know, the 1547 definition of deer states an interconnection system or a supplemental der device that is necessary for compliance with the standard is part of a deer. So it basically says that any of the other equipment, other than the generator per se, is actually part of the DER. So that would include all of the interconnection equipment and all of the interconnection facilities that are directly associated with the. The DER. Right, but that's not in our rules. That's in the standard. Right, I know, but it. Okay, I'm just clarify. Yes, exactly. But that's a reasonable clarification. Is that. Because that's one of the problems I'm having, is that a deer includes the generation equipment, whatever it is, or this battery storage, but it includes all the ancillary equipment required, and you can't have one without the other. So you can't have a Der without all of those other interconnection facilities. It's part and parcel understood from a practical standpoint. From a policymak making standpoint, I'm still not understanding whether we can't just say Der plus interconnection facilities where we need to. Yoki. Sorry. Yeah. Caroline, I think what you're asking is what Inna go back and double check. But at first blush, I don't see any reason why you would. You know, I think the inconsistency that's created is with the 1547 definition. And, you know, we. We'trying to make it a best practice to align the interconnection rules with the 1547 definitions where possible, because they're both used extensively. But that doesn't mean that there has to be perfect alignment. And this might be one of the places where it'd be appropriate to. Not to have some divergence. Okay, thanks. Yeah, seems like a lot of work to do that. Now, maybe the engineering handbooks could clarify that. When translating our policies to 1547, folks should consider, you know, der plus interconnection facilities to have the same meaning as der Inee. Okay, thanks everybody, for the discussion. I like to approach there at the N. Caroline, see if there's reaction for that. Okay. I guess we can move on then. The next slide kind of goes over some of our non consensus areas. These are ones staff has identified as lacking consensus. Process changes have raised concerns now. Now, as we discussed earlier, some of the process changes are designed to incorporate the new sections. Other areas where there were suggested changes or expedited processes we've tried to match with our current processes. But then with that in mind, hopefully as we move forward, there will be places to expedite and streamline the application review process. There's been a great deal of discussion on the substation back feed screen or substation transformer back fed screen, and I think there may still be some issues there for the commission to decide the line configuration screen. The joint utilities would like to keep the current language as it helps. My understanding is it helps avoid negative impacts from ungrounded generators on the network screens. The IrEEC would allow generators with nameplate rating up to 50% of the minimum load, while the joint utilities prefer the lesser of 5% of the maximum load or 50. Then the interconnection handbooks are another area. Without consensus, that interconnection trade associations couldn't be here today. So I'm not sure how much we want to go down discussion of that road without them here. Finally, in supplemental review, there's a penetration screen with export capacity at 100%, while the joint utilities would prefer 90 or 80, 90% or 80% if there was a single transformer. Now, I don't know if we want to go through any of these at this point, but. Or if there are any other large areas of non consensus disagreement that I should note as well. So I'll just kind of open it up in case there's any discussion here. Hey, Ted made that with AEC. If I can speak more on the line configuration screen. Sure, go right ahead, please. Yeah, so this, I think maybe is one item that we could benefit from having a short call between IReX stuff, April, maybe, maybe an every",

        "text": " that would happen in an IOC, if you bring in the carbon constraints is you might get a lower cost, you might find that there's another way to achieve Oregon, Washington and California's carbon constraints. There might be synergies between the three. There might be actions that lower the cost for all three. There might be things that lower the carbon emissions overall to the system and then give you a different base to go off of. So our belief is it's time to get back to what ips are supposed to be, which is looking at the total resource cost of the company to meet its load going forward. And the total resource cost is the cost of complying with the existing rules that exist in Oregon, Washington and California. So we think really what we need now is to not acknowledge this IRP, to take back and re evaluate how IRPS model resources, what is the preferred portfolio? And in the future the company needs to come back with the preferred portfolio that on its own meets the carbon constraints that are required by its states. And staff did have one of their not conditions, but one of their expectations is that the company would come in with a preferred portfolio that could meet those. And we think that's fundamentally necessary if we're going to reach a really at leastase cost lease risk approach. Thank you'happy. To answer any questions. Yeah, thanks. And so I see that argument, and I see it as to some degree being grounded in the orgon, the classic Oregon IRP guidelines that require the most likely regulatory compliance future to be the base case, and also to the utility plan that achieves a best cost and risk portfolio for all retail customers. I don't think what you're saying is inconsistent with those. I think the question that I have is I don't see staff asking for that in the IRP update because of the more fundamental nature of the overhaul that would be required to get there. And I wanted to confirm, I guess, whether you see that the same way as staff and are seeking for us to create direction for the 2025 IRP, or whether you're seeing this as a lift that should be accomplished for the IRP update, which I assume is, you know, largely done as part of the reality we're dealing with. And I don't know what the company would need to be able to do this. I don't know how big of a lift it is. In my mind it's necessary if the IRP update doesn't have a preferred portfolio that works, that there s very good chance cub won't be able to recommend acknowledging that, because again, it doesn't it doesn't represent the least cost, least risk for Oregon customers, but it may have elements of action plan elements that reduce carbon emissions and move us in the right direction. So it doesn't mean that it's a waste of time. We have seen IoT where we can't acknowledge the overall plan as lease cost, but there are certain elements of it that we think are relatively no risk to acknowledge and move forward. So I don't want, I want to be careful about saying an IRP update that doesn't do this has no value. I think it has value, but ultimately I think we need to get to a better planning basis of planning basis that plans with carbon constraints in mind, not plans, does most of the planning, pretending they don't exist and then trying to back them in in the end. And if you're right and we have to wait till 2025 for that, but let's talk about it, let's put it on the table, what's necessary. So in 2025 we get to it. I don't want to wait till 2027 for right. And I think there's a lot that's complicated here because it's wrapped up with the CEP acknowledgement and what you regard as a necessary foundation for the CEP. And I think people probably will take different, different views of that and it'll be holistic too. So I appreciate the clarification there. Commissioner Tawi, any questions for Cub? So I hear implicit in this that the MSP cost allocation question would happen later, outside it would be a different conversation, perhaps. Although a least costly risk portfolio likely generates benefits across the six states. So sort of the assumption I hear underlying this is that am I imputing the right assumption? I think that's so. Ultimately, the IRP isn't a cost allocation model. It doesn't allocate cost est states. Now when you bring in carbon constraints from some states that don't do others, it starts to have some impact on that. But the IRP may also inform MSP. If the IRP says this is a cheaper way to do it, a lower cost way to meet the needs of all their states, including the western states and the eastern states, then I think it may actually help MSP get to an answer. But they are somewhat distinct processes. They've got to ultimately be harmonized. But I think at this point what we first need is to figure out what's the total resource cost of the company and the preferred portfolio",

        "text": " to the division 82 rules to reflect what we're doing in division 39. So the first one is just a small proposed language. It's kind of in line with similar rules for division 29 related to qfs. And what else? Oh, one other thing that wasn't in the presentation that went out yesterday is the net metering facility needs to be added to the definition of applicant in division 82. Then we'll incorporate the two different division IEEE definitions in division 39. There any thoughts on there? Just some minor cleanups, Ted, I'm sorry, I think I'm slow on the uptake here, but just to confirm. So the definitions in Division 82 are going to apply to both and so the, and then we're going to tweak the language a little bit more as reflected here in order. Yeah, right now the applicant does. The applicant definition in Division 82 references the Purpa facilities, but it doesn't reference net metering facilities. So that's being added in the definitions in here in Division 82 will for the most part be applicable to Division 29. There's a revised definition proposal we'll go through here in just a couple slides as well. Is that helpful? Does that answer your question? I think I probably just need to keep looking and just keep quiet until I've had a chance to look more. I'm sorry I haven't spent very much time with yet, but please go ahead. He it's not a problem. It just came out yesterday. So I just wanted to highlight that 82 as currently proposed not, was not reflective of the net metering changes as well. So hearing no other comments, we'll move to the next slide. This is just some minor clarifications. We wanted to clarify that the rules reflect AC, not DC. So you'll see those are changed in the proposal. And then there's some additional language incorporated in the Division 39 proposal to incorporate the supplemental review process for tiers one and two. I don't know if there are any thoughts there? Well, now it's about the time we take a break, but I just have a few more slides. So people want to break or should we just plow forward? Okay, I guess we'll just move forward. Hearing nothing, this may be helpful. Jordan. This is the definition proposal update. If you recall the slide, we had this in the last workshop and original intent was to have the definitions the same in both divisions. And there was some thought at the last meeting that that might not be the best idea. And so instead of putting unneeded definitions in the different divisions, we kind of simplified all that. And so here's the tables updated. So the new definitions in the upper corner, those are needed again to incorporate some of the changes we're making. Export capacity, some of these things. So those are all in Division 82 off to the right. The ones that we're going to be there, they're all crossed out. We will not be incorporating those in division 82. Those are division 39 definitions. And down below, we won't add all of those to division 39. After all, there's just a few right now. Like electric distribution system is currently in there. We're going to change it to the distribution system to be more in line with what's in 82. We're going to incorporate the IEEE definitions. There's an RPA in division 39, so we need to put the reference point of applicability, some of the discussion we've had earlier today. We may add some more of the new definitions as well. Export capacity, nameplate rating that heard the comments and we'll think through that. This did help answer my question. Thanks, Ted. Okay, guess we can go to the next slide then. Unless there are any thoughts here. And here's just some. This is a definition of written notice. We've had some back and forth with parties on this. The intent here is to use email as opposed to snail mail as the default. This will be incorporated in both division 82 and 39. And so if there are comments here otherwise, I will consider this a consensus issue. Okay, this one. There was discussion at the last workshop about whether we use distributed energy resource or small generated facility. And you see the two definitions as they currently are at the top. Now, staff has proposed a modification to the definition of small generator facility that will incorporate the energy storage system, the battery. And then the thought was we could drop a distributed energy resource and just rely on this definition of small generator facility in division 82. And so I will stop there to see if there are any comments. Yeah, thanks, Ted. I think I agree that using one term will be easier and yeah, will aid, you know, readability and consistency. And so that makes sense to me. Seems like you prefer small generator der makes more sense to me, but that's not a big deal. The one part of the definition of Der that isn't there in your",

        "text": ", chair. Any other questions for new sun? So, yeah, just real quick. So, Jake, you're basically asking if the conditions of the May 1 requirements will still be in effect if we provide a waiver. Is that correct? Yeah. The clarification request is, is this new price schedule going to include all of those updates or are we waiving their obligation to make those updates versus what those assumptions were a year ago when they last updated them in this process? And then. Yeah. The point about schedule was essentially asking you, as we have this discussion to reflect on the fact that we have been served a lot of really new information, including an entire new resource that nobody's ever looked at and effectively just could gut prices in one way. We've never also, sorry, looked at the solar plus storage premium. And so we haven't done the math on that. And we have some concerns about that. And so folks have not had a chance to do that, much less you engage outside consultants and things to really run through these models which are, do require real time to investigate. And we're not probably well prepared to tell you. We think we're going to try to meet that deadline. But we wanted to make you aware that there's a lot of complexities. Like, we don't know what we don't know because this has never been put in front of anybody before. And arguably, lo is out of scope in terms of the battery. I guess I don't hear you disagreeing with staff's recommendation, though, here. We generally like it with, without clarification. But we would hope that you would provide space to the extent new issues are discovered to be investigated. Because, again, PGE has rendered upon us new things that nobody has ever seen and looked at before that are not part of these updates. How long would you propose? Like six months? I hope not. No, I mean literally, like, I mean, you're agreeing or disagreeing with the staff recommendation. I hear you agreeing, but sort of disagreeing. So I'm trying to get a sense of, like, what might we hear from you? I. What I guess I would recommend is that you ask parties to make good faith efforts to investigate and identify issues commensurate with aspiring to achieve that schedule and, you know, be supportive and prompt on any discovery issues that may come up in the meantime. And that to the extent material issues are raised, you know, be receptive to some short extensions, you know, two to four weeks. We don't want this to drag on either. And I think it's worth reflecting on maybe in this discussion, is the battery appropriate to included? All right, now, you guys have heard us advocate in the past, but that actually hasn't been discussed by the commission. Like, is PGE's formal capacity resource actually a four hour battery? That is sort of a unilateral assertion by Portland at this point. And that has to cover their 24 hours needs. Again, is that 8 hours, 10 hours that hasn't been discussed. And it radically bears on the model. And I almost think that if you stuck an eight hour battery and, for example, you'd end up with a negative energy price based on how their model works for capacity less energy, which would be a weird outcome. But arguing that a four hour battery covers all their capacity needs is also very optimistic. O understood. Thanks. Okay. Any other public comment on this item? All right. Not. Not seeing any other hands. Please feel free to unmute yourself if you would like to make public comment. Okay. Erin Upperon from PGE. Go ahead. Hello, can you hear me? And. Yep. Wonderful. This is Erin Apperson on behalf of Portland General Electric. I just wanted to make a quick public comment that we appreciate the commission taking up this matter today but also would have concerns with what could be perceived as more of an open ended timeline here. And so we would support the timeline suggested by staff here. Thank you. Thank you. Any questions for Erin? For PGE nop? Okay, thanks. I wanted to circle back with staff on one question before we move to deliberation. And what's before us today is a waiver of the May 1 update and a schedule that. That we expect to meet in the sort of combined post IRP and may want to update, roll up. Right. Staff gives some reasons why that schedule is important that I think should be really important to the community overall. Namely that we're sort of messing around with inputs into a framework that staff is looking to evaluate in, um, 2000 and sort of wants to put the resources there. With that said, our decision today doesn't absolutely set a schedule in stone. However, I guess when we deliberate, it might be helpful to sort say how we're thinking about this in relation to the considerations that staff puts out. But the",

        "text": " to pick that 50 is the right number? Or is it that we need to talk about directionality in this action item for the near term, for this action window? And more importantly, I think eto'very, ETO's current budget cycle and next budget cycle. Hi, thank you for. Okay, go ahead. Yeah. Hi. Thank you. My name is William Gurky. I'm with the Oregon Citizens Utility Board. Thank you, chair Decker, Commissioner Thompson and Tani, for giving the opportunity to speak. I think we're more talking about directionality on this cost. I think we're kind of early in the phase. We think PG really responded to what we were talking about. And I really appreciate PG looking at near term cost impacts and leveraging non ratepayer funded resources to fund energy efficiency. And we see some uncertainty around how much is available. 50 states are competing for federal funding. Are we going to be able to meet the demand? In Oregon? There's a lot of coordination with third parties. PSF is a huge source of funding. But PSF only serves Portland. And Portland General Electric is not just the city of Portland. There's a variety of rateayers outside the Portland city limits. So I think our thought and our process behind that is I think we need to maybe acquire more than what they're doing. But we. There's a lot of moving paces on this and we'd like to spend some more time thinking about that and provide aret recommendation on how to move forward on that specific item. I appreciate that. I think in this context, clarity about timing would be very interesting to me. PTE's reply comments really centered on 2026 is when new resources needed to be available. But, you know, we know we have labor issues and we, there's a whole range of things that need to happen, if that is the number and the date. And so as you think about that, as you engage in that, I would be really curious how the conversation about timing evolves. So thanks for that. Thanks for engaging the question. Okay, I don't think I have anything further for Cub and I want to get through our last sor of named participant and then get any hands up for anyone else. I'll thank you, Jennifer and will for participating on behalf of Cub and thanks for your comments. I'll ask that we move to the last name commenter, which is n Sun Energy. Good morning. Good morning. Chair Decker, Commissioners Tawy and Thompson. Marie Barlow in house counsel on policy and regulatory affairs with N Sun Energy. I yeah, I'll just briefly describe our round one comments, and a lot of it is fairly repetitive of some of the other comments you've heard today. So I will try not to be too repetitive and just highlight areas where Nusan might have raised something different or unique. Nuisance's comments primarily focused on this sort of economic and technical feasibility aspect of HB 2021 compliance. And what NAN has hoped to do is to bring some of their expertise with the Bonneville Power administration system to light in terms of PGE's transmission assumptions in the plan and to really look at, you know, whether those transmission assumptions are feasible. And one of the pieces with the Wyoming and Nevada proxy transmission resources that we've really been struggling with is like, what exactly is PGE looking at? That they think those are feasible in the timeline that they have articulated, and they've stated that they agree if those assumptions are based on a new resource build or a new transmission build, that it is not going to be feasible within the timeline that they've assumed. But they say that it also is looking at, you know, other options that could add incremental rights, including on existing regional systems or potential particip, pat and interregal transmission builds that are already underway or scheduled to come online, but they haven't really given any detail about what it is exactly that they think is out there. And so our concern is that if there's too much reliance on something that isn't feasible in the timeline, that that's assumed, that the models and assumptions will be selecting resources that, or be focusing attention towards resources that won't actually meet the 2030 targets. And so we would prefer that the models actually look at resources that would surely meet that 2030 target, you know, something closer to load or something that, you know, relies on a transmission project that is actually underway or. And yeah, we just have, haven't been satisfied with those trans, those assumptions to date. We also agree with the energy advocates on that some more focused transmission work workshops would be useful to kind of dig into the issues a little bit more, especially with regard to the BPA assumptions. And we could get into that more in future comments or if such a workshop is held. The second issue that N. Newsan raised in our comments was about how we're going to actually track the emissions reductions year over year and ensure that there's",

To increase its profits, Northwest Natural needs to focus on ensuring its current infrastructure is safe for users and prioritize adopting actually proven techniques to meet long standing climate requirements. Please order Northwest Natural to end rateayer subsidies for new hookups entirely and build on the clear direction you gave in Northwest Natural's IRP to ensure its decarbonization strategy incorporates electrification. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, and the next person I see on the list is another of the Christriy Collins folks. So I'm going to allow you to talk. I'm going to ask you to unmute. Should see that message and that will okay, thank you. I see you've unmuted. If you could state and spell your name for the record, then you may provide your comment. I'm Deanna Palm, D E a N N A P A L M. I'm president of the Washington County Chamber of Commerce. The Washington County Chamber strongly supports Northwest Natural's line extension allowance, which we believe is essential for fostering economic development and enhancing community well being in our region. While focusing on decarbonizing the energy system and protecting resiliency for residents. Washington county is a vibrant community with growing residential and business needs. Northwest Natural's innovative proposal to enable the building community to affordably deliver housing with resilient energy systems will significantly benefit our local businesses by providing residents with reliable, cost effective energy options that are crucial for daily operations and long term planning. This proposal is not merely an enhancement of resiliency, it is an investment in the economic foundation of our county. Moreover, this project aligns with our commitment to sustainability and responsible resource management. Natural gas plays a pivotal role in our transitional energy strategies, helping us balance growth with environmental stewardship while ensuring that the energy that residents depend on is available even during extreme weather. By supporting this proposal, we are endorsing a vision that promotes growth, reliability and sustainability, a vision that is integral to the future of Washington county. Therefore, I urge to the commission to consider the substantial positive impacts this project will have on our community and to approve Northwest Natural's line extension allowance. Thank you so much for your attention and consideration. Okay, thank you. Okay, and the next person I see is Ktherine Bax. Yes, actually, this is Anne Turner. My partner's name always appears on my zoom and my name is spelled a n n t u r n e R. Chair Decker and commissioners Tany and Perkins and Judge Frucece, thank you for the opportunity to speak. I'm a physician, retired from a career and community in a community health center, caring for farm workers, workers that are among the most vulnerable to the devastating impacts of heat. I now volunteer with Oregon physicians for social Responsibilities healthy climate action team. As such, I urge you to deny Northwest Naturals's request to increase its rates to rap payirs. Following the same playbook as the tobacco industry, the fossil fuel industry that is northwest natural continues to focus on three main denial, delay and delude. They have certainly been successful in diluting many in the homeuilders industry, asking ratepayers to pay for subsidies for gas connections in new buildings locks in burning methane for the next ten to 20 years. The climate clock gives us less than seven years. We cannot afford new fossil fuel infrastructure of any kind. Methane warms our climate and pollutes our air both indoors and out. In terms of delusions Portland, I mean the Public Utility Commission has already rejected northwest Naturals IRP that plan to reduce emissions by using renewable gas, RNG and hydrogen. Both are falsle solutions with RNG mostly coming from factory farms and landfills, industries we don't want to promote and hydrogen ignites more easily and is more explosive than methane. It places lives at risk. Both are enormously expensive and neither are a climate solution. Requiring warning labels on and banning advertising of tobacco products resulted in a drop of tobacco use from 40% in the 19 sixt to about 12% today. It's time to decrease the 40% of oregon households that heat their homes with gas to 12% or less and support them in transitioning to more efficient electric heat pumps, 300% more efficient than gas furnaces and also providing air conditioning. The Public Utility Commission can move us in the right direction by denying Northwest Natural's rate increase and ending ratepayer subsidies. Ratepayer funded subsidies for new gas connections and incorporate electrification rather than RNG and hydrogen into its strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet Oregon's climate goals and to support affordability for environmental justice communities by not increasing rates thank you so much for all you're doing and the opportunity to comment this evening.

        "text": " of effective grounding is very confusing and gets mixed in with safety grounding or earthing. And as a result of that, that, and if you go back and research the history behind this, a lot of this was based on analysis of large machines from 50 to 80 years ago, to be honest, is the critical thing is to evaluate overvoltage conditions during ground fault conditions. And to me I would rather see the whole concept of requiring effective grounding and all the weird calculations that people use for determining whether it's effectively grounded enough, eliminated. And focus instead on overvoltage conditions because it's over voltage conditions which cause the damage, not the lack of effective grounding. That actually is a kind of a weird thing as a way of avoiding over voltage. What you're really trying to do is prevent ground fault over voltage. So to me a screening of such a nature should kind of stay away from the concept of effective grounding and instead screen for does the event or the transformer configuration risk causing ground fault over voltage conditions. Thank you. PGE runs a four wire grounded system on our distribution. And we're asking to have a grounded, effectively grounded connection to our system which lines up with how we run our system. If we have an ungrounded connect ##ection it's going to cause problems on our system because it does not line up with how we run our system. And you know, the rules that we're proposing, which are the existing rules line up with that is, is that if you are connecting on a four wire system, you are connecting an effectively grounded transformer. And we've not seen a problem with folks providing their own transform meeting that requirement. Yeah, I have absolutely no disagreement with you. The disagreement I have is just that the purpose of effective grounding is to eliminate overvoltages on unfallteed phases during phase to ground faults. And that's what you're trying to do. And all I'm saying is that it's very confusing for the end user. Not necessarily. And the utility engineer to determine exactly what is required. And especially if you look at the calculation processes required for determining whether you pass an effective grounding screen. They're based on machines that are highly inductive in nature. And the reality is that inverters are not. Inverters do not have passive inductance, they're not a rotating machine. And the calculation methodologies that are required by utilities are predicated on the existence of a highly reactive source. So as a result of that, it gets very difficult to satisfy everybody's requirements that effective grounding is met. Whereas it's much more straightforward to analyze, study the system and verify that ground fault overv voltages do not occur. The end product is the same thing, is that you're avoiding risking damage to the system. It's more a matter of how you're going to approach that. I totally agree with you. The system needs to be effective grounding. But what I'm saying is it's very confusing. Thank you. Yeah, this is Brian. If I could jump in. I have to take a look at what the screen actually says. But I'm curious how the. Well, the goal of our revisions was to make sure that an ungrounded three phase inverter. Would not be considered ungrounded for the purposes of the. And so I'm curious how the utilities would evaluate that regardless of the transformer intation. So what has typically been an issue is a three phase transformer. Connected to a wide y interconnection transformer. Which might be just if you're connecting onto a building, say a w to y transformer already present ungrounded three phase transformer around their utilities have in the past an ungrounded source where in fact, it operates differently. The same rules. That's what we were trying to get at here. And as Maat mentions in the chat, this is based on work that EPRi has done. EPri had basically helps designed the screen, or did the screen. So this is straight out of the batteries'report. And so, yeah. Curious as to how utilities would the differences were. An ungrounded source. If the current screen was used. Yeah, and if I can, before you respond, just say in addition to Brian. So, yeah, so this was, as Midot notes in the chat, one of the big things that we worked on as a part of the toolkit for the interconnection of, you know, battery storage technologies. And was identified, you know, by APA and I. Rec is one of the key revisions for modernizing the screens. To really account for not only batteries, which is what the toolkit was focused on, but differences between inverter based ders and rotating machines. And Ted here, I just want to say that listening to Mike, it's, you know, part of this whole investigation is to bring transparency and that for the developers and whatnot. So if it's confusing for the developers, hopefully we can find some way to make it less confusing. Keep that in mind. Thank you",

        "text": " Meaning not all I use our balancing authorities or vice versa. What's important to whack in the balancing authority is that every, the combination of all the balancing authorities covers our entire footprint. So when we get information from them, we know we're getting information that covers the entirety of what we need to be looking at and analyzing. Next slide, please. So before I jump into more of the results, I just want to kind of offer that high, high level overview from Wex perspective. And I want to start by acknowledging that after 20 twenty's heatwave event and similar events in the last few years, industry and regulators policymakers have been taking action to really shore up our resource adequacy outlook in the west. And what we're seeing in our analysis is the results of some of that action. We have made a dent in the risk that we see from resource adequacy, but it certainly has not been eliminated. The delayed retirements and the expedited building of resources has helped in the very near term, and we're seeing that in some of our results. When we take a look at studies from 2021 versus our 2022 study, we are seeing some improvement. But I want to caution folks in thinking that we've made, you know, that the problem is no longer there. It certainly is still there. And I have to note that some of what we're seeing in our analysis is really due to a reduction or an adjustment of load forecasts out of the Pacific Northwest and entities the in the Rocky Mountain area. So we did make a dent. But I don't want to paint too rosy a picture in terms of what the near term risk looks like, because there is still risk. In addition, and we'll get more into the kind of results behind the second bullet here, the likelihood and magnitude of resource adequacy risk as we measure it has increased compared to previous analyses. Also, in the long term, the risk hasn't. It does increase over the next ten years. We're seeing, the data show us now that that risk is going to increase over the next ten years, largely because variability drives resource adequacy risk. And variability is, is looking like it's going to increase over the next decade. Now, there is an exception to this, and that is the region that Oregon sits in, and that's at Northwest power pool, northwest sub regiongion, or what I'll probably refer to in shorthand as just the northwest. And that includes Washington, Oregon, and then the western side of Idaho and a little bit of western Montana. That is an exception. I'll explain a little bit more about what I mean in just a minute on that one. Next slide. So WECC measures and defines resource adequacy risk in two ways. And this is the first way, and that is to talk about demand at risk. Next slide. And we talk about it in terms of demand at risk hours. Now, I don't want to get into technical weeds, and this is the most technical weedy that will get, but I think it's worth a quick explanation of what a demand at risk hour is, because this is at the core of our analysis. A demand at risk hour is an hour in which is a chance for loss of load. It is not an hour where it is expected. Again, we're dealing with probability, so we're looking for those hours where that possibility for load loss is above some kind of comfort level. And we call that comfort level a reliability threshold. We use a one day and ten year reliability threshold, and this is a pretty standard threshold to use in the industry, but it's often calculated in different ways. For WECC, we calculate this out to that one day in ten years, calculates to about 99.98%. If you just divide the 24 hours into all the hours across ten years, where we take it next is we apply that 99.98% reliability to every single hour of the next ten years. And any hour that is not 99%, 99.98% reliable gets flagged as a demand at risk hour. So the question is, how do we know if an hour is 99.98% reliable? That's what the middle of this chart is showing you. And I'll walk through this very brief. We take the expected information from the entity for demand and resource availability. That's that, that center line, that vertical line in between those two curves, that's the expected value. But as we know, nothing really runs to expectations. So the question that we need to answer is, well, what other things, what other combinations of demand and resources could happen? And what's the likelihood that those combinations might happen? And that's where we bring in historical information and some statistical analyses, and we draw these curves around that expected value and we one is a demand curve and one is a resource availability curve. And what we're really interested in here for reliability purposes is where do those two curves overlap? And you can see in",

        "text": ". I think that under the other timelines, utilities would actually have 25 business days to. Ten business days to review for completeness and then 15 business days to evaluate. So I don't think we want the. I think it's. We just. There's some inconsistency that we need to fix because we don't want it to be deemed approved before the deadlines are actually. Have actually passed or reviewing it. Yeah, if those timelines are definitely. Look into those. I know that the 20 day deemed approval comes from the net metering division 39, I think, so I'll have to double check on that. Okay. That might be how it ended up being inconsistent. And, yeah, it took us a while to piece it together ourselves because the timelines are in different rules. So it's very confusing. But I'm pretty sure that there is a conflict there that we need to fix. And then can I add, Jordan, sorry for cutting you off, and you're about to move on it just, you know, I think, you know, if the 20 day deemed approval, you know, comes from the ne rules, and then we're seeing that what is included in the, you know, the sgip rules are not, you know, going to meet that. I think that just underscores, you know, the need for a consistent tier one process between the two. So. Thank you. Yeah, so my last issue was in tier four, and I had noted this was on the agenda, but maybe I was confused about this. So the joint utilities how to pose the language about doing the system impact study and taking into account facility design and operating characteristics. We felt like we don't exactly know what that means, but we have concerns about what it could mean. And this is something that we haven't discussed at all as far as I know. So our preference, as we said in our comments, would be to take that out and let's deal with tier four studies comprehensively. But barring that, I do think we need to have more conversation about this and understand what staff is thinking it means. I understand the concerns there. It does seem like in the studies you would want to take in the facility design and operating characteristics. So I think that's why it was left in there. But I can double check on that as well. Yeah, I think like maybe that makes sense theoretically, but when it gets down to like, what do you like? Is it an operating characteristic if the applicant says I won't generate over this? Or is it they've installed something or is it we're only going to generate between noon and 05:00 p.m. and how is that enforced? You can see how there are a lot of possibilities for what that could mean and potential concerns. I think. Yes, I understand the concerns. Yeah. I think the most important thing is just to be clear so that we don't, you know, my common refrain, I've litigated enough complaints that I just want to try to avoid them. Yes. I haven't probably done as many complaints as you, but I would like to avoid those as well. So hopefully we get to a place there. Thanks. And if I could chime in on this, I think that there's a lot of opportunity for. Yeah. Future discussion here. I don't think we, you know, we were excited about the idea of, you know, opening up the conversation about what this would look like, but I don't think that we are wedded to having it included in this version of the rule revision. I do like including study the facility according to how it's proposed to be operated because I think that that does get you to at least not, you know, for example, assuming that a battery is going to be providing frequency response service when it's like not planning on ramping that much. But the overall process of doing time varying in interconnections is something that's being discussed in lot of other states. And I think I agree, should take a little bit more time and effort for the parties to think about before implementing. And hopefully before too long, we'll have a certification standard that incorporates that. And then, you know, we could again incorporate that certification standard into the rules, which, you know, I think meshes with the goals of many parties to avoid disputes.",

        "text": " which was 1998. The operational improvements that we have made over the last few years have helped us through these unprecedented times and unpredictable our generation availability remains strong even when system peaks occur and region wide capacity was constrained. We have increased the accuracy of our restoration times to improve performance and customer communications. New analytics and automational tools enable us to identify critical customers and prioritize our response. In September, we proactively implemented our wildfire mitigation procedures by enacting a public safety power shutoff in high risk red zone areas. On the next slide, we refer to in 2022 our execution of a very strong capital investment to address the reliability of our generation grid, resiliency and demands of customer growth. Recently, we have seen unprecedented growth. The past two decades, the average growth rate has been one half to three quarters of a percent annually. The past two years have been over 3% annually. To put that in context, that is approximately 100 mw annually or the capacity of three to four distribution substations. Accelerating this growth further are the federal IRA IJA and chips funding acts, which incentivize customers to one add solar on rooftops and as a result we're seeing over 200 new requests each week. Number two, EV's, which we anticipate 50% of all new cars sold in Oregon, will be electric by 2030. Number three, growth of the chip manufacturing facilities. We see over 1000 growth in the Hillsborough area alone. And finally number four, general electrification, which will keep an underlying growth rate of 2% through 2030. Our capital investments have built new and refurbished substations, transmission and distribution, ensuring safety and reliability. Additionally, we have restored and improved our generation fleet. After the complete move into our integrated operations center this past spring. We are now beginning to transform our business and look to operate in the western resource adequacy program, enhance our participation in the energy IM balance market, and build out our virtual power plant. We need to continuously sustain, grow and transform our system to match the challenges ahead. Following the passage of us Bill 3684, which is the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs act, we have been working with the Department of Energy and numerous partners to submit applications for grants that will be directly benefiting PGE customers. And I know we have a special meeting coming up on that, but I wanted to at least reference here that we began submitting our concept papers in November. We've already submitted ten, which have led to three full applications, approximately $478 million in grants. Last week, we received our first invitation to the next level of interviews for our first project, listed on the slide as wind solar battery storage control for grid services. We're very excited to continue through the DoE process with fingers crossed will be granted each award. Also listed on the slide is a partnership application along with the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. This proposal proposal projects excuse me. This proposed project will strengthen the transmission capacity in the region and bring additional renewables from reservation lands to the greater Portland area. We have also partnered with Mitsubishi and joining the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen hub program with the possibility of utilizing the boardn site for hydrogen generation. This is one of the ten sites nationwide to be considered. It is important that we leverage funding to improve and transform our infrastructure while making our clean energy future affordable. As I know you are aware, in recent months, law enforcement and the industry have noted a significant increase in acts of sabotage targeting the electric grid. At least 14 such incidents in Oregon and Washington have occurred since June of 2022. We have taken swift action to address the security of our system. We have completed physical security upgrades that began in 2020 to 32 of our substations and ten of our operating centers. We have completed inspections of 561 PGE assets and sites specifically, and we've instituted a risk based tiering process for our substation facilities for further hardening. We will need to continue to take swift and thorough action to protect the integrity of our system, working with local law enforcement and accelerating many of our hardening efforts. I have to also note that we recently hired an ex FBI senior leader and a Portland Police bureau senior leader who are really transforming and making a difference for us in our physical security arena. A final note, we can not harden the system to protect it for all possible attacks. So our program also includes redundancy as a critical element in the system, risk mitigation. So with that, I want to turn it over to Brett who lead us into the markets and the transformation of our energy. Brett? Right. Good afternoon, chair Decker, Commissioner Tawy and commissioner Thompson. For the record, my name is Brett Sims, vice president of strategy, regulation and energy supply for Portland General Electric. I'm going to refer you first to slide ten. You know, as I reflect back on the last couple of years,",

        "text": " wouldn't be sufficient. It would have to be, you know, the nameplate rating of it would be no more than 10 mw. Well, I don't see how you could interpret what's written there for division 29 that way, Stephanie. I mean, yeah, because it. We got, there was some language in there that would have maybe allowed the. The 20 megawatt program down to ten megawatt, but it was intended to make it so. It's the nameplay capacity of the inverter. It's not focused on the inverter. It says, I'm looking at it right now, inverters, energy storage devices or other equipment within the facility, affecting the facility's capability to deliver useful electric to the grid within the facilityk about where else the control would be. I mean. Okay, so I think we're splitting hairs here. I mean, the overall intent is. Yeah, it's based on. Based on. I mean, most often it's going to be. Right. A DC overbill with the inverters. Right. And or use of the storage device. But would you agree that under the FERC, know, the recent. Kind of. Not recent, but now. But you know, the Montana case, that a nameplate capacity of 80 mw, it couldn't be an inverter with a capacity of 100 mw that's programmed to allow no more than 80 mw. Right. It has to be. The maximum capacity of the inverter would be 80 mw. Is that right? There's no affirmative ruling in that case saying you can't achieve the same result with some sort of control system. But in that case, the limiting factor was the inverters. So I think it's an open question. Hasn't been. But there is an old FErC case where there were controls and it wasn't an inverter. It was literally like some sort of control system that cut off the supply to the grid before it hit the 80 megawatt amount. So, I mean, there's no circuit court opinion endorsing that. But there is an old ferc decision. I don't recall the name of it right now, but I could send it to you. Okay. And I'll say that I think we're comfortable with the, you know, the utilities are comfortable with the idea of looking at inverters. I think when you start talking about looking at something else or relying on other limiting devices, I can't say for certain what each utilities position is, but I think that's where we start to get less comfortable. And it also seems to create a lot of, again, uncertainty in a lot of gray areas. And I want to reiterate that what we're talking about here is the definition that the eligibility. So this is going to be the very beginning of the process. And it strikes me as one of the worst possible times to have a dispute because we haven't, there hasn't been a lot of information exchanged and it seems like we want a really clear black and white definition that it's really obvious that you're either under these rules or you're not. Well, I think it's going to be the applicant's burden to prove that it's got cap. Its system is going to be designed and study to not put more than 10 mw on the grid and demonstrate what that equipment is. Yeah, but the utility also has really short timelines, especially in some of these. If they're going under the screens, it's I think, a matter of like ten days and then 20 days. So they're not going to have time to like bring in a bunch of engineers and fully assess the system and decide if they agree, you know, with the control or whether it's the right control or how it's going to be set. I also know, and maybe someone from PGE can speak to this, but they've had experiences where, you know, they've relied on an inverter being set to a specific level. Then, then the manufacturer sends a letter and says it's set at this level and then manufacturer does a software upgrade and suddenly that person is regularly sending to the grid more than their interconnection agreement allows. So I think it just gets complicated and much more risky are when you're relying on things like that. Wouldn't that be a breach of the interconnection agreement, Jordan? It is, yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, if someone's going to break the rules they said they were going to follow, I mean, that's a different situation than drafting a rule that doesn't allow people to actually comply with the rules and achieve the result we're trying to get. I mean, I think we would be willing to agree to the same language as the division 29 rule, kind of like what staff has here. Happy to strike the. When operated in compliance with the interconnection agreement, if that's causing concern for the utilities. But I think we'd have to consider something that's focused solely on an inverter, which is, I think, different. And you're going to have an incons",

        "text": " you so much for pointing that out, shared Decker. And actually, it's a point that I should have made. We've presented or projected a 2025 budget because that's what we've historically done is put together to your budget. But I would say in this current environment, this is kind of an anomaly. And I would say that 2025 budget should be viewed even more as a placeholder, more than an actual projection, because once we engage multi year planning next year and get better intelligence on delivery of additional funding through IRA funds or PsF Oran the climate protection program. You're absolutely right. Chaird DECr any of these projections. If we see workforce development, for instance, investments because of the IRA or P up really taking off, we would either you shift our focus. You know, PF, of course, only covers port Portland. So we may back off workforce development activity in the Portland area and refocus funds for the rest of our service territory, for instance. That may result in a change in the number you see on this slide or not, but it would represent a change in strategy. And of course, if it does result in actual, you know, say, workforce development throughout the state because of IRA funding, you could result in a change in the number as well. But it's those types of engagements that multi year planning will allow for next year that will inform that 25 budget, which we're really viewing as sort of the beginning then of a five or six year budget and plan. So you're absolutely right. These numbers based on best intelligence now, what we think could happen, I would really hold them with a significant number of grains of salt. So I mentioned workforce development. So let me just talk about what we are planning on doing next year in that space. It really is to build a pipeline of contractors and others who are needed to work in the energy industry so that we can remove some of these barriers that are slowing our customer process projects. We've actually been in conversation regarding these needs with, we have a board member, Eric Hayes of IBEW. We've been talking to representatives of the Portland Clean Energy Benefits Fund and of course, nonprofits who are active in trades and workforce. And we're starting these conversations with Odo, with the Oregon Department of Energy, and we're working to really understand where our new workforce efforts and funds focused and to identify how can we inform and extend those efforts and close those gaps. To share just a few examples of planned work in this area. We've been in conversations with the National association of Minority Contractors to help them secure and operate a job training facility for Portland area contractors. Our funding, of course, we're not paying for the whole training facility, but it would just, just be a portion of that. But it's there to help expand training opportunities and build that contractor network, our base to increase workforce in this space. We're also exploring additional training centers and other communities outside of the Portland metro area. We're also supporting another area. Another activity in this area is we're supporting clean energy training modules that can be incorporated into existing licensed pre apprenticeship programs like constructing Hope and Oregon Tradesswn. One of the things that we've learned and are noticing with workforce development, even with some of the PSF funding, it may go to support general workforce development, but it may not be focused on actually producing the expertise we need in the clean energy space. The augmenting existing apprenticeship programs like those offered by constructing hope and Orego organ tradeswomen so that they're training people on how to install the most efficient heat pumps properly, how to do heat pump water heaters and make sure we're not putting them in interior closet spaces and things like that. That's part of what we see our role as is making these more clean energy specific rather than the sort of general workforce development funds we'd see flowing from these different sources of money. So that I think you'll see coming into focus more in 2025 and beyond. That third area there that you see is really investing in partnerships with community based organizations. Those are organizations, of course, who can reach customers and really deliver clean energy services in communities with our support and of course, to acquire cost effective savings for our portfolio. So, in fact, increasing support for these nonprofit organizations that serve environmental justice communities is one of our 2023 OPUC equity performance measures through our innovative community partner funding approach, which is what I do have some more detail on later if we want to see it. We've been demonstrating how community based organizations actually can deliver incentives to the communities they serve for installing energy efficient upgrades, including customers experiencing low incomes, customers of color, and customers in rural areas. These organizations really understand their community's needs and most importantly, act as a trusted connector between energy trust and a customer. In 2024, we'll be expanding our community partner funding and increasing support for and the number of participating community based organizations with the goal of adding a minimum of six additional partners",

        "text": " interconnection study processise that might arise if the customer is required to execute an interconnection agreement or not. And from the joint utilities perspective, the larger risk here is that we will have executed interconnection agreements for QFS that ultimately do not sign a non standard PPA. And once those interconnection agreements are executed, they operate as an effective constraint on the interconnection opportunities for other customers, whether those customers or other QFs or other non QF generators. I think Mister Stevens actually illustrated this consequence quite starkly when he noted that you can suspend your interconnection agreement for years, you can sit on those rights forever, and nobody else can interconnect behind you as long as you have those priority rights. And avoiding that scenario is precisely why the joint utilities made the recommendation that they did, in order to ensure that we're not operating under constraints that don't need to be in existence. The other point that Mister Sanger raised that I just want to touch on quickly is the potential consequences to customers that are renewing their interconnection agreements. And in Oregon, I believe this is true for both the large and the small generators. There is an effective rollover provision in the existing interconnection agreements. And so when customers are in the process of renewing that agreement, the existing agreement typically evergreens until the new agreement is put in place. So as a general matter, interconnection customers are not cut off from the grid while the subsequent interconnection agreement is negotiated and ultimately executed. And so I think that's an issue that's certainly, that's important to think about but I don't think it's one that should be impediment to adopting the joint utilities recommendation in this case. And with that I will pause and I'm available for any questions that we also have other folks on the line from the other utilities that can answer questions to the extent there are already. Thank you. I think my main question and just to take a break from the whole order of operations issue is the QF parties have argued that the ERaAs study report should include some information about the extent of curtailment that's needed to, to avoid the upgrades identified in the NRI study. It resonates with me from where I sit as well. Imagine that we get into a dispute of the type we've been talking about here in the negotiation of the terms of the PPA and sort of where is there any objective foundation from the information that really only the utilities have, transmission services have, or I mean transmission side has about the scope or the possible solutions. Thank you. And I think, you know, we addressed this in our request for reconsideration or clarification that was filed on the heels of order 23,0000 five. So I would certainly, I don't want to contradict or I don't intend to contradict what we said there, but I think there's a couple of issues. First, on a fundamental level, in order to grant an energy resource interconnection service that includes some level of curtailment will require the utilities most likely in most circumstances to rely on non firm transmission to deliver that QF generation to load. And the reason for that is if they, for example were to subsequently designate that resource network customer and use their network transmission rights in order to deliver that QF to load, then that may very well trigger the exact types of upgrades we're trying to avoid with this policy. And so if we're in a space where we're relying on non firm transmission to deliver a QF output to load first, that's not something that is looked at in an interconnection study. They don't look at subsequent transmission service rights or opportunities that would exist after interconnection occurs. Second of all, forecasting over the life of a 20 year PPA when and if non firm transmission is going to be available is a virtually impossible task. And so I think that creates the first sort of impediment to providing a firm number or estimate or forecast of curtailment going forward. I think the other scenario where you could have curtailment potentially, or you could have a resolution as if, for example, a QF is a ten megawatt QF. Perhaps if they were a six megawatt QF, they would not trigger the particular network upgrade that they're trying to avoid, in which case you could conceptually say, well, we just curtailed four megawatt of their generation. We've solved the problem. That also is something that is not studied in an interconnection study. We study the interconnecting generator at its output with the understanding that it's asking to be interconnected at its full output. Now, an interconnection customer could propose a modification under the existing procedures to change their size, in which case they would get restudied under a different size, and that may provide them with some information about how curtailment could or could operate if they were to move forward. But in a typical interconnection study, we don't sort of study increments down from the requested generator size to see at what point a particular upgrade",

        "text": " House Bill 2020 1. Second, that as we're making that progress toward decarbonization, that this would retain an emphasis on resources that operate reliably and ensure that we're able to deliver energy to our customers at all times. And then third, as we are focusing on decarbonization and resource reliability, that we're also working to reduce risk. We note that there's both kind of macro risk as we think about the energy landscape in the west and the ways in which that's changing, and then also risk associated with contracting and projects and project delivery. So as we think about that 1st 1st principle as we make progress toward decarbonization, I'll note that we've received a lot of really helpful feedback from stakeholders, including expanding our commercial online date window to better align with our integrated Resource Plan Action Plan. We received recommendations that we adopted around introducing flexibility into the interconnection and permitting processes to allow narratives. Would it makes sense to do so and to make sure that we are providing opportunities for a robust response to this RFP. As we think about reliability, again, we've received a lot of really helpful feedback that we were able to adopt and incorporate here, including retaining distinct requirements for capacity products and energy products, and having those be separately with, you know, their own sets of minimum requirements. And we also point to our preference to retain an emphasis on high value transmission products in alignment with things like the Western Resource Adequacy program to ensure that as we're acquiring resources through this RFP, that we're doing so in a way that is likely to lead to reliable operation. And then third, as we think about risk reduction and the feedback that we've heard and the steps that we've taken, we worked with staff and stakeholders to put together an expanded sensitivity analysis list. As we think about the ways in which we would look at responses, how we would build portfolios, recognizing that as we decarbonize and as the west decarbonizes, there are more counterfactuals that we should be seeking to put forward. There's more analysis to be done to make sure that we're acquiring the right set of resources and we're pleased that we've been able to receive that feedback and to incorporate that into our process here. And then we have worked to adopt some contractual recommendations and also seeking to emphasize the importance of things like project labor agreements and helping us to reduce risk of project delivery and maximize of our confidence that projects are compliant with Oregon state law. So with that, we'll conclude kind of the opening statement here. Thank you for the opportunity to be here. And again, thank you to staff and stakeholders for the engagement and feedback throughout this process. Thank you, Jacob. Commissioner Tawi, any big picture questions for PGE? Yeah, I appreciate your articulation of the principles and how youe framing this procurement. You know, transmission constraints are coming forward so clearly and loudly in this RFP as they have fundamentally shaped every RFP since I joined the commission and probably all of the ones before. But certainly it'become, this incredibly intense and difficult issue. And I'm wondering how, given the constraints on transmission and interconnections and we see Nipsey raising Puget Sound energy and Idaho power, offering their transmission rates to bidders to maximize the value of those rate. Why PGE is from a big picture level. Right. We'll get into the details, but why does it fit your approach? Take such a different approach to your transmission rights in the RFP, they make some compelling arguments about maximizing the value of those very precious rights in the context of ratepayer cost. Sure. Yeah, big question. I think as we look at our system and as of our unique positioning, as we have generators that are elsewhere in the west that largely leverage Bonneville Power administration's transmission system to deliver to where we serve load in the Portland metro area, we really have transmission rights that are associated with how we get generation power. I think we have a diagram in our clean energy plan, integrated resource plan that shows we really engage in transmission rights that are associated with specific generators. And we ve largely use those transmission rights and have appropriately sized those to be able to serve load during all hours, including during peak hours. I think the balance that we are trying to get to here is how do we retain the rights that are associated with generation today and make sure that we're able to continue to use those to serve load reliably? And then how do we bring online new resources that may be located in different areas, and how do we make sure that we're able to have those serve reliably as well? And I think that there is a question for us around, you know, if there are transmission rights associated with PGE's existing generation in the gorge, for example, and we get a resource that's located somewhere else in the west that would like to leverage rights, how that would work from a long term redirect perspective. One, whether that would comply with Bonne",

        "text": " can think of only one to date which actually gels with what Mister Basin just said. I believe we renew NW west specifically and not Northwest Energy coalition raised in our comments in LC 82 the suggestion that that particular policy statement regarding benefits to local communities did likely have particular import in the context of considering small scale renewables and the small scale renewable requirement that was included in HP 2021, just based on the history of that issue that I probably do not need to repeat here because you are amply familiar with it. Okay, thanks. That's concrete. I don't have anything else. Okay, thank you Mister Stevens, I see your hand up, but we're going to continue through the list and we'll return to you. Time allowing. We now go to Oregon Solar, solar and Storage Industries association for three minutes. Thank you. Alj Melgrin OA is similar to other parties in this proceeding is resting on our briefs a couple of points the statements of policy should have relevance in the commission's implementation of House Bill 2021. As stated in many stakeholders briefs, policy statements are not binding, but they do provide insight into the legislative intent of the statute and should be able to guide be a guide to implementation implementing discretionary provisions of HB 2021. One discrete area stakeholders identified is determining other relevant factors to assessing whether a plan is in the public interest. Additionally, the policy statement is not an in state resource preference. Instead, the statement of policy references the lofty goal of zero greenhouse gas emissions while also highlighting the desire for direct benefits to flow through to communities. Using the policy statement as influencing discretionary operative provisions of the statute does not implicate the commerce clause. Asking a utility to identify the direct benefits to Oregon communities flowing through their irps or rfps does not require every project in an RFP to provide the same benefits. An out of state project can still provide benefits to Oregon communities, though they may be different than an in state project. And I'm ready for any questions you have. Yeah, could you expand on that a little bit? I'm not sure I totally catch your drift. Maybe provide an example of how that would happen. Yeah, an example of that would be, let's take an RFP for example, and you ask in the RFP for those, each bidder to provide information about the benefits that that project will have. An out of state project will still provide benefits in terms of resiliency, though it may be different than a battery located in Oregon, which may provide greater benefits related to resiliency and also jobs. I mean, just. Yeah, I see what you're saying. You can ask that question even handedly is what you're saying in a way that's not based on the geographic location of the project. And you may find that a particular way. Something is connected to the grid or operated, or something is providing more local resiliency somehow than something that is connected differently, even though it's located in the state. Is that of what you're saying? Yeah, precisely. And I think that that's exactly what I was trying to highlight. Okay, thank you, Mister Watson and Mister Stevens, you are actually up first for issue four. So we will turn it over to you and I'll start the five minute'clock. Thank you. Alj Melgren, Che Decker, Commissioner Taney, and following up on that point and tying in, into this, it is just an issue of that there are practical ways to apply these policies that don't create the conflicts involved. And as we look at this, it's that practical view that I would ask you to consider. A pump storage project like Goldendale, which is across the river in Washington, will employ people in the state of Oregon who travel across the r ##iver to do, to work on those projects. And the power line will come across the river and come into an Oregon substation and increase the resiliency in our state, et cetera. Those are the types of benefits that you can do and you can adopt in terms of procedural approaches here and practical approaches. You know, for example, safe harbors. You might provide, as FERC often does, a rebuttable presumption that a project built in Oregon creates jobs in Oregon, and some sort of practical test that a battery that is attached to a city in Oregon is more likely to have direct benefits. And you could scale those based on the miles of power lines that could burn down between here and there, which are practical considerations. As we think about these types of practical approaches on continual progress and prompt action, and consider a similar practical approach. Ultimately, your job is to oversee the actual success of the procurement and reduction of the energy, the reduction of emitting energy for the state on the schedule provided. So when we think about what is sufficient to see continual progress, we have a basic litmus standard. I think the first thing you need to do procedurally and practically, is to convey to",

        "text": " able to call on your neighbors. You know, I mean, somebody is going to be red dispatching the transmission system to. Right. Make this work. Right now. That's probably the eim, since we're there, and as you said, in a few years, we'you, know, we could be markets plus or Edam else, but there will be. But as you pointed out earlier, over the coming years, specific transmission rights, except to the extent that you're required that you need to have transmission to meet your rap program, the specific transmission rights will become less and less important. Great. I appreciate this. Thank you. All right, we're not going to circle back around on issues today because we want to get through these. But appreciate your comments, Henry. And we'll go next to ask Pat to introduce the issue around interconnection, which I guess I sort of thought got softened a little. But let us know where you think we are here. Thank you. Chair Decker. No, I think that's right. So there was a recommendation in the independent evaluators report that suggested particularly loosening the final shortlist requirement for a facility study. And one of the things that was in that report that was very, very helpful was as an appendix, there was, baswide included some slides showing sort of the delays or the length, I should say the length of time for some of the various studies that need to be completed for interconnection. And although the IE only specifically recommended loosening that requirement around the facility study and looking at some of those slides, it really looks like the system impact studies are, you know, the delays on there can. Or the length of time to get those studies complete can be even longer. So I sort of recommended putting this on the agenda just to sort of raise the issue of whether there should be some additional flexibility around this. Whether the system impacts studies is another area in which sort of a narrative description or having. Being in the queue for the study, even if you don't have it completed, but you can provide a sort of narrative description should be included rather than being sort of prohibited because that's a minimum requirement as it is right now. Okay, thanks. Appreciate the desire to explore this issue. And we'll go first to PGE to give a response to whether there's more flexibility there. And if not, why not? Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the opportunity to respond. I'll just start. Maybe from a macro perspective, PGE, in response to some of the recommendations we heard in 2021, have we've been pushing forward our interconnection view reform to move from a serial cue to a cluster study to help alleviate some of these delays. You know, I think that moving to, like a first ready, first serve type approach is something that we think will help kind of reduce this, you know, the kind of the lengthiness of this process moving into the future. And then, as Pat noted, you know, we. This is an area where we are seeking ways to be flexible. Right. We kind of move from having facilities study complete to facility study agreement at the time of final shortlist. I think what we're grappling with on the system impact study specifically is that this is really kind of the beginning of the process. And, you know, I think that we're wanting to balance being able to accommodate projects and to be flexible and to respond to some of the feedback that we heard from Valerie and from Jake and from Ireian that the intent here should be to make sure that we're pulling in viable projects and giving them a path to deliver, not to be so rigid in the minimum requirements that we are kind of losing sight of the goal. And that's really our intent. So I think with system impact study, we start to run up against that as if a project has not started or not kind of completed the system impact study at the time of bid. It calls into question whether they'll be able to meet some of the cods, especially those that are a little bit nearer term. So I think that, and I think there are two different angles to this, too, which is one working with PGET and on PGE system, and then at the other is us managing the timeline risk if the bidder is requesting a system impact study on a third party transmission board provider. And I think for both of those, you know, the balance that we're trying to get to here is ensuring that a project is viable and is likely to move along on a timeline that is consistent with what we're looking. Forky, any questions for Jacob on this one? No other comments on this one. Jake, go ahead. Thanks. Tried to wait there and give others a chance to jump in on this. On the interconnection, I think just say again, put a score on it. You know, having different degrees of maturity is really important. You know, my general take right",

        "text": "Good afternoon, everyone. Today's May 30, 2024, and you're here for a special public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. We are here in docket number LC 82 to get an information only presentation from PacifiCorp introducing its IRP update. Again, this is kind the interim step in between irps, where the company updates certain things and lets us know what's changed. Like I said, this is an information only, a public meeting, and that means that we won't be allowing public comment. Today, we'll have the company deliver a presentation, introducing its IRP update and CEP clean energy plan supplement, and we'll have some questions from commissioners along the way. The opportunity for public comment is set out on the docket page. That includes a written comment, which we ask to be filed by June 14, and a second commissioner special public meeting scheduled for August 8, at which we will take up any decision making that need to do will allow for oral public comment as well at that meeting. So written comment, June 14, oral comment and decision making on August 8. Today is our kickoff meeting where the company will present what they've filed. Without further ado, I'll ask the representative for Pacific power to come on up and have Candace that bring up their slides. Good afternoon, Rick. Hey, good afternoon. Just a sound check. Make sure you can hear me. Got you. Hey, wonderful. Thank you. So good afternoon, chair Decker, Commissioner Tawy and Commissioner Perkins. Nice to meet you. I think for the first time virtually here today, at least for me. My name is Rick Link. I am senior vice president of resource planning and procurement here at Pacific Corp. And I'll be guiding you through the slides. And I can see them. They're up on the screen that I think we submitted yesterday afternoon and encourage welcome questions, I think, as we go, obviously, and if there's any dialogue we want to have, just interrupt me. I've got no concerns or issues with that whatsoever. So if we can, I suppose, jump right into this, if we could go to the next slide. They won't spend a lot of time on it, but it just covers the high level topics that I'll be walking through as, rather than going through the individual elements listed here in the agenda slide. I think I'll just frame up how we thought about presenting this information to you today, which really, it was a focus on continual progress across our plans, whether that's through the IRP update or the C clean energy plan itself. You know, broadly, those two documents represent our long term plans. And, of course, the clean energy plan gets more specific into the, our compliance obligations and how we're planning to meet our targets under HB 2021, more specifically. But I'll hit on each of these items here listed in the agenda, pretty much in that order. I will note that as we get to the end of this presentation when I start, where I give you an update on our new resource acquisition activities. I do intend, and I hope she's here to also get some input and comments from Nikki Koblia, who's our senior vice president, BFO and treasurer at Pacific Corp. As well. So Nikki will be joining me at that point of the presentation. If we could please go on to the next slide. Thank you. This is another slide I am certainly not going to read to you. It's largely not largely, it's reflective of language from one of the commission's orders related to the topic of continual progress. And I only want to flash this up here to indicate that, you know, we are viewing that topic, that term, that term of art, so to speak, of the continual progress under HB 2021 kind of through this lens. And I think, importantly to understand that we at least are not seeing this as a requirement to explicitly, as noted in the first sub bullet, to require a linear trajectory of expected emission reductions, that there is a broader scope associated with the topic of continual progress under the rules as we understand them. So we'll go on to the next slide and I'll kind of begin with where we've been right a bit of a short history of our actual emmissions on this particular slide going back from 2019, you know, annually through 2022. And these are public information as reported to DEQ as well. So out there and available for everyone to go see. I will note as, because I inquired just to maybe front run a potential question in case you have 120, 23 is not included on this yet because that data has yet to be fully validated, which gets completed, my understanding, in August of this year. So kind of stopped this trajectory on 2022. I did check with our team and it's our at least our expectation that we will at least see some level of reduction once that data",

And I'll just note as the slide is changing that we open big, kind of big policy docus. The commission has the authority to do that as well. And some of those are listed on this slide. So we'll have big policy dockets even if there's not a statutory driver. But if SAP commission, a utility, other stakeholders kind of flag the need to look at something broadly, either for the first time or because it's been around for a long time and we want to consider modernizing it, those will come up, too. Okay, so this is my attempt at trying to capture things that might be like, topically of interest to folks. And hopefully I did an okay job with that. But I just wanted to lay out that in addition to these major, you know, you put the big rocks in person and then you let the other, the smaller rocks kind of fall around it. And tackling like our big policy and economic regulatory requirements that there's a whole bunch of things that happen outside of the here's our plan, then we do our plan, and then we spent the money on our plan. Can we put it in rates? Like conversation, there's all sorts of other stuff that's happening. So, for example, one of the big areas of interest right now, as the utilities, the electric utilities, are kind of decarbonizing their whole system is what chunk of the investments are they making that are going to be focused on driving benefits to the community, that focused on building projects in Oregon, focus on building projects with resiliency benefits, like a microgrid. And so while we're doing these big planning conversations, we also have a few like framework conversations happening where we're specifically looking at the compensation framework for small scale resources, the interconnection policies for small scale resources. We have an investigation to modernize that, and we've really focused both of those on making sure we're ready for small scale resources that have high value to the system, high decarb potential, other benefits. So resources like hybrid solar PL storage, and then there's a whole host of other flexible lo plans and that kind of stuff that is happening kind of alongside this broader planning conversation, there's also a focus on energy efficiency modernization. So as we're moving towards these decarbonized frameworks, like extra attention is needed on energy efficiency because the modeling doesn't always capture in planning, doesn't always capture the benefit of not using a kilowatt hour of energy, for example. So we have a couple of dockets specifically focused on tweaking that, that value of energy efficiency conversation. But then we also the energy trusted Oregon implements a lot of the energy efficiency programs for the state, and their annual budget process is really where you can make an impact on the specific expenditures, like what energy efficiency programs are really going to target. So while it's not a PUC process, if you want to engage in like, let's say, what types of customers are getting, are being targeted with energy efficiency programs, are they targeting folks who benefit from electrification? Like all that stuff that is all done through the energy streust budget process. So, and then once all of that's worked out, then it comes to the commission for approval. But our recommendation would be to engage with the energy trust at their phase. And that, I think begins around August. We've also got a bunch of things going on about voluntary products and customer options. We have an ongoing docket where we're often looking at improvements or modifications or overcoming challenges to the community solar program. If anyone's interested, large customer retail choice has kind of a big open policy docket. We have like a smaller advice filing where Northwest Natural has proposed to add a renewable natural gas component to its existing, like, voluntary clean program for customers. And then we also have anticipate the potential by the end of the year that Portland General Electric might file a tariff that allows local governments to put their residents on a specific green product that might achieve their renewable and climate goals faster than the utility has to do under HP 2021. So there's that. And then we also have kind of an ongoing conversation about getting better at data collection, demographics, and metrics to support some of our new and emerging policy areas. So like, one example of that is the equity metrics associated with energy efficiency. We have some interim metrics in place, but I think that'be revisited soon. And then as we implement the HP 2475 Energy Affordability act, we'll probably have some new dockets to open related to that as well. So that I think. Is it, Nolan? Hopefully I touched on some things of interest and pointed folks in a couple of directions they might want to look at. And I'm Bill for question. Great. Thank you so much, Caroline. I just want to express my appreciation for Caroline",

        "text": ", I think the assumption that when the resource itself is providing power it is within a system that is tuned to kind of meet the reliability standards. And I think the fact that the rap and the state RA program exists now hopefully support, support that assumption in terms of. Remind me where else we went with those comments. Sorry, I can't remember what else y I mentioned the wrap, you know, y pricing is a reference point. Y. Yeah, that's, yeah. So I do think, you know, the wraps ELCC numbers you know, I think are something that we can look into, in terms of either utilizing those to evaluate the reasonableness of the capacity contributions that, that we are seeing from the utilities models or you know, even you know, as we work through um, 2000 and adjust our proposal to utilize the wraps fy contribution numbers as kind of a stand in for what the utility does itself. You know, the WRPs methodology is based more on a regional approach or I guess sub regional approach. So it's not necessarily one to one in terms of what the, the utility system, you know, how a resource integrates into the utility system, but more generally into how it integrates into the region itself. So it's you know, maybe a little bit different, but at the same time you know, with the current plan to have all the utilities in the wrap, that will be you know, kind of the gold standard for capacity modeling in terms of like how they, you know, the bar that they have to meet in order to show that they are resource efficient. Though I can see an argum that both ways there in terms of transparency. You know, I do think the RAAP does provide us some ability to look at those numbers. I also know that, you know, currently some of the utilities don't use Fullcc modeling. You know, they use like an LL, LLP approximation methodology. And I see you know, Dan's hand up and I don't know if PAC is planning to move towards a full LCC model, but you know um, 220 eleven does contemplate kind of different approaches and the, you know, the needs and the computational times of full LCC model runs. In our proposal we have the ELCC because it is kind of the preferred process. The downside is that it is a complicated model and does require a lot of work to get the inputs in. And it makes transparency to some degree difficult to achieve. You know, you can get LLp numbers on a calendar year and estimate what the capacity contribution is based on their, you know, capacity factors and generation profiles of particular resources to look into. Kind of again, kind of fact checking ELCC numbers. But that's all stuff we can get into in U 2000. And I appreciate, you know, the comments that you made. Those are all things that we've tried to consider as we've come up with this proposal and we'll look further into a zoo forward. Yeah, thanks. I appreciate the thoughtful response. And yeah, I do think that you know, the wrap is a sort of floor, you know, is probably a good safety for on the LOLp front. I think we really think that having that heat map will be really valuable and especially you know, for non standard projects that might propose something that's more tailored to the utilities actual needs and the capacity and loss of load exposures that they have, having something that would, will enable folks to design things to solve those problems, you know, including the law, the non standard environment, I think it's a really good idea. I mean, I think in that dock of the utilities testified repeatedly how great Lolp was and how simple it was until the end. And then all of a sudden they changed their story. I think, you know, your observations about the simplicity of that and the transparency are really valuable. The other thing here is I think it's time to add some dominant subgeographies for these ELCC contributions. You know, we need like North Willamette Valley, South Willamette Valley for Pacific Corp. You know, they have a handful of pocket geographies, they have load service in and you know, having those primary places and maybe some primary solar DCAC inverter load ratio variations to spell that out so that people can design things that contribute to those things. And just especially noting that as some of those places will have materially different contributions into the evening peak demand hours where the cost of the customer the highest and the capacity and loss of lowad probability are the highest. So providing pricing that incentivizes somebody in the valley to designionl 1.7 dC ac ratio that contributes more in the evening, or a south facing system that contributes better in the winter when Whenter's peaking, those things will enable the market to respond and serve those needs, especially in a world where there probably won't be transmission built in time to",

        "text": " in it. I don't know if this was an oversight. I added the power or not, but I wanted to note that that hasn't been updated yet. And then on charging management, I don't o before I get to that was to cover the forecasting costs, you know, in response briefly to SAS'comments on the forecasting costs that the ie agreed with Nipsey on this point, I think one of the main issues with the forecasting costs, you know, that can come up in an RSP like this is you're asking the bidders for the PPA to pay for the forecasting costs at their solar or wind plant, whereas it's not clear necessarily that will be baked into a utility ownership bid separately, there's an issue with. It might be more efficient for the bidder to acquire its own forecast and provide that to Idaho power. I think what we heard Idaho power say, or staff say is that Idaho power, that doesn't work for them potentially. But the first issue is still potentially an issue that you have kind of a cost, a cost bias issue, and that is a concern with the Inflation Reduction act. We could see more utility ownership interest in solar, and we did have, I believe, one of the benchmarks closed yesterday as a Windg plan project. You had some questions on charging management. I think that, you know, I can give a long, detailed response. It is a complicated issue, but I think at this point we're comfortable in what I have the power because blood thep goes forward based on everything else, all the other facts and circumstances. So I'll stop there and see if there's any questions. Okay, great. So sorry. Just one clarification. Which provision was removed from the PPA form but not the BSA form that you' referring to a couple points ago? The delay damages amount. The delay damages. Right. So I have agree to make that a blank. And they did that in the PPA, but there's a separate BSA battery storage agreement, and now it's still in there. Okay. I don't have any particular questions for NIpsey at this point. Commissioner has anything from you? Sure. If I could clarify this one, and I hesitate to bring it up if it's one that you haven't already brought up. But I just wanted to make sure I didn't lose track of it and I needed to understand it a little bit better. I think one of Nipsey's recommendations, number 13, maybe, was the term sheet should be made available for each type of resource. And I was curious if that has been resolved or if there's still a big issue there or if it's just not such a big issue. I understood the concern to be that different types of resources might need more direction in terms of what I know power is looking for with respect to that resource, but I'm not sure. Again, don't dive into it just because I asked the question, but I just was trying to figure out if it's still in play or what was that stake there? I mean, we still stand by the recommendation and would make it. You know, I think that and ie did agree with us on this. And I mean, the concern is we had forms that are just for a BSA, a solar specific PPA, and you're going to have wind bids. Idaho power did provide a wind performance guarantee provision, but there's other types of bids that it's not clear what the commercial terms will be like. A solar plus storage hybrid structure, for example, or potentially a geothermal plant or maybe a pump hydro storage. So it makes it challenging for bidders who want to bid that in. So I think the thing we're balancing at this point is that kind of ambiguity. Idem of powers asked those bidders to submit their proposal and so I guess they're kind of guessing as outside of the power's expectations. I guess the concern that we would have is mitigated to a certain extent that there's no scoring penalty at this point for marking up those forms. But we still do believe that the term sheets would be helpful recognizing I of power really wants and needs to move forward. The RA, on the other hand. Thank you. That was helpful in understanding that a little bit better. Okay, great. Thank you. I think before I ask if there's any other public comment, I'd love to just quickly ask Adam to come on back up and just respond quickly to a couple of those points. I think the ones I was particularly hoping to hear about. What would be the question about section 8.4 as it relates to the negotiation of facility purchase and then the delay damages in the BSA form, whether that's an oversight or not. But feel free to speak to any of those other things and then I'll give staff the same opportunity before we go to broader public comments. Yeah, maybe I'll take the easier one first and that's the delay damages. We would agree to remove that from the BSA. We had focused on staff's",

And that, that proved to be, I think, from our cost benefit analysis, you know, is more cost effective than the solar plus storage, but it. It requires a lot more time to be implemented. And that, that grid need. That we had needed to be addressed in one to two year time frame, which didn't allow enough time to implement the non wire solution. So that was kind of what led to the conclusion of that. But. But I think, you know, moving forward, I mean, all of those things that we. The engagement processes that we used to get the feedback for the non wire solutions, both, both our, you know, public workshops and our local engagement, that work, we found that worked really well. We plan on incorporating that into our future DSP processes. So. And then I think, you know, as far as, uh, the. The. The planning horizon, we are looking at now looking at a ten year horizon instead of a five year to allow, if we do find any grid needs, it allows more time to implement a non wire solution to address that. Okay, well, that's helpful to hear. And, you know, it's just something that I just don't want to lose track of as we've done this good work and. And when we haven't quite incorporated the full kind of cradle to grave into our processes, you know, I just want to keep asking about that. So thanks for your response. Anything else for Jonathan before we let him go and get back to our motion? No. Great. Thank you. Thanks again to the company for digging in on this effort. Oay, I'm not, as you all know, a great expert in parliamentary procedure, but I think we can just have a motion still sitting out there and still subject to being seconded. I believe so. So I'll happily second. I concur. The motion carries. And staff's recommendation is adopted. Thanks. Okay, let's bring Nick back up and hear a little bit about Idaho Powers distribution system plan. Great. And I'll just quickly confirm my audio is coming through. Okay, thank you. Appreciate that. Again, for the record, my name is Nick Sayn, senior utility analyst in the Energy resources so resources and program development section of the Energy Resources and Planning Division. I'm again joined by Natasha Smith, assistant attorney general for the Oregon Department of Justice. And I'll now present the basis for staff'recommendation on Idaho Powers 2022 Oregon distribution System Plan and again, we'll be happy to answer your questions that come up in your deliberations. Next slide, please as with my earlier presentation, I review stat recommendation. I'll discuss several aspects of Idaho Powers s plan. I'll note stakeholder feedback and next steps. Next slide, please. Staff recommends the commission accept Idaho Powers plan. The plan has various strengths and meets the guidelines. Next slide, please as a high level summary, Idaho Powers plan estimates spending approximately $13.7 million from 2023 to 2026. The plan provides a new level of insight into the company's distribution planning practices, increasing understanding in multiple ways, and I'll now present several aspects of the plan. As with my other presentations, these are intended to serve as diverse examples that includes strengths and opportunities for improvement. First, I'd like to address investment planning. The Idaho Power plan lays out clearly about a dozen capital projects that address grid needs in the next four years, and as as a result, we have more insight into this upcoming utility investments of this sort. Idaho Power was the only utility to present capital projects in this way. At the same time, estimated spending is limited to capital investments and so insight into spending on other efforts presented in the plan. For example, reliability programs is limited. Next is forecasting grid needs and solutions. As a result of the plan, we have increased insight in Idaho powers load and der forecasting practices. Readers also have increased and improved insight into practices for grid needs identification, for example, the company's use of small area studies and maintenance and diagnostic programs. At the same time, there's an opportunity for more specificity in the discussion of how solutions are developed and evaluated, for example, criteria for scoring and ranking, benefit cost quantification or project prioritization. Finally, non wire solutions the plan doesn't demonstrate using community feedback in the development of the company's non wire solution pilot proposal, and this is an opportunity for future improvement. The plan does demonstrate the capability to analyze and implement non wire solutions. Indeed, the company developed and pursued a non wire solution for transformer need in the substation serving the waser area. This non wire solution, a battery energy storage solution, is currently in progress and will be Idaho Power's first distributed storage system. Further, the plan identified a second nonwire solution opportunity at a substation in the gen",

        "text": " that month, and we selected those hours to be our premium peak hours. The other part is the capacity contribution. So how much is contributing to that capacity avoided. So for this, as part of the year 2000, we apply the same methodology that we're using our IRP which is the ELCC methodology that we have. And the last part of this order was to get a payment that is a standard for energy and volumetric for the capacity payment to the part. So we start diving in a little more into the details part here. This is how our profile looks like in a twelve x 24. Here highlighted in light blue is the premium peak hours. So we have similar to what Pacific Cr show for the winter. We have that double part so we keep it continuous as well. So we have 2 hours in the morning, 2 hours in the afternoon for the winter and then we have a consecutive block in the summer for that part. The values they are showing here are normalized to one mewatt into that bar. But we also run it at 50 milgwatts and I'll show that in a minute to the part. So this will be the output normalized to one meilwatt for this resource. So if we go a little more into the details that we have here. So the hours as you can see there for January to April and November December are six to 08:00 a.m. and five to seven. So that's our double peak that we have. And for May to October we have the seven to eleven. We normalize everything to one meilatt. Our capacity contribution each and ELCC turned out to be 65%. And I do have a little more details on how we come up with that part then the total value of capacity was distributed around these 1220 8 hours which are 4 hours per day excluding air holidays and Sundays. So Monday through Saturdayept dinner holidays will take that part. And just as a check we have how many, what is the capacity factor during these premium peak hours is around 87%. And similar to what we see before. We found that over the winter there are days where there'no enough solar to fill out that storage in those premium pickak hours. So we do have under 100% in terms of the capacity contribution that we have. So we apply this ELC methodology which is consistent with the IRP and allignce pretty closely with the UM 2011 best practices. So the cap of this interim rate is 50 millwatts. So we model a 50 milwatt pv with 50 millwatt storage for hours where the best is only charged by the battery and disc charge only during the premium peak hours. So here we run six different test years. So six different weather profiles and then we took the average. Here is where we get that 65% on the ELCC. Before I move forward there any questions? I think I saw question flash but couldn't see it. Andre, I might ask you a question about this myself. Is Ryan, I believe your filing states that the proxy resource is a four hour grid charged resource. But you are confirming to me here that this is a. It's only charged by the solar panels. Are you talking about the one for the avoided cause or the one for the ELCCQ? Which proxy resource? Because here this is one only to get the ELCC, not for the pricing. Okay. Okay, thank you. I'll think about that. Okay. Are you referring to the. There's a paragraph in our cover letter that talks about. That's exactly it, Mark. Yes. Yeah. As Andre said, all of our calculations are using the this batteries only charged by the solar. If that was incorrect in our filing, it looks like no worries at this point as this ELCC is based on without grid charging. That's what we're really interested in. Thanks Andre. And Mark, if we look at schedule 85, how this one looks like, and this is in our schedule that we have, a lot of the columns remain the same. So the value of the capacity price remain the same, the energy price and the integration charge remain the same. So what we propose for this solar plus storage is this capacity contribution, this contribution to peak that which. So 65% to have and then which hours are going to spread around. So that's the premium pe capacity factor, which is 87%, or it's going to run that out from the 86.9 something. And that turns out to be we're going to divide this value between these 1068 hours. Now, the other columns that we have here are the same calculation that we have before, but we change the inputs that you have. So now the value of the capacity is your capacity value times u lcc that you have in there converted to megawatt hours. And the capacity allocated to the",

        "text": " all those things are things that someone's going to take into account when they're financing the plan. So I think our proposal is to see, you know, when we get the compliance filings, maybe we'll have more visibility into what that added value the utilities think there is with the ability to update it. And hopefully the Qs could choose one or the other. I think it would also help inform, you know, policy going forward, forward if the commission were to provide the two options. If we provide just the one, you know, and no one signs up, we won't know for sure why they didn't sign up. So that was our proposal to move forward on it. I can take questions that you might have, and again, we appreciate everyone's efforts and thank the commissioners for their attention to this issue, too. Any questions for Greg? I guess if I could just ask r1 quick question on that topic, on that proposal that there's two different rates. You have an idea about how we would go about determining value? Presumably the rate would be higher if the utility has the choice to change the peak hour over time. I just don't have any idea how at this time a utility would assign a value to that. Or were you proposing that the non flexible peak hour rate would just be lower by virtue of the fact that it can't be changed in the future, or did you have any thoughts on that? Well, yeah, I think it's a question maybe for the utilities. We haven't seen any of their proposed rates and my understanding of the position they were taking. But going back in time, staff initially proposed to the premium peak hours would be fixed for the term of the contract, and the utilities pushed back and said, no, we want to be able to update that. Our, you know, our hours could move over that time period. So it's worth more, the resource is worth more if we can do that. So as I understood that to mean they were going to calculate a lower rate if they couldn't update the premium peak hours. But we haven't seen a rate proposal, and that's part of why we want to see, as part of our proposal, to see what the alternatives, so everyone knows what they're making a decision about. Thank you. I guess I already kind of revealed my inclination that the two streams, I guess that I'd rather work things out on one stream. And the question I have for you is, when we see those tariffs along the schedule that staff has outlined, do you understand, or am I correct in understanding that your constituents will be able to propose limitations, I guess, on the movement of the hours at that time, my understanding of staff recommended that that would be a part of the compliance process. If you go with the staff proposal, yes. Okay. All right, let's move through some other comments. If there are no more questions for Greg. Sorry. We'll go first to Marie Barlow and then to Ellie Hardwick. Go ahead. Good morning. Good morning. Chair Decker, Commissioners Tani and Thompson. Marie Barlow here on behalf of Nan Energy. I did want to echo Greg's comments on supporting the staff recommendation. Largely in this case. I think they did a really good job here, balancing a lot of the concerns that parties raised. And I think, yeah. So want to just thank staff for all their efforts and, yeah, just. And one point of clarification is that Nuan initially opposed the 50 megawatt cap, but I think with staff's clarifications, is generally okay with it now, and agrees with the comments from the trade groups that in the event that that is reached, we would like to see a, you know, process in place at that time to, you know, get some other rate put in place absent any major changes. Nuan does also have concerns with the proposal to allow the premium peak hours to vary over the term and has four primary concerns with that. The first is that it would deprive a QF of the right to have a fixed price under perpa. They have the option to, you know, provide energy or capacity pursuant to legally enforceable obligation for delivery over a specified term, and with avoided cost calculated at the time that obligation is incurred, and so want to make sure that that fixed price option is still available for QFS. The second concern is that it's inconsistent with how the rest of the methodology has been done, has been implemented, where a lot of these sort of IRP inputs get fixed in the embedded cost of, or embedded avoided cost price that gets calculated at the time the power purchase agreement is executed and so stays consistent throughout the term of the agreement. And then the last two concerns is that it undermines the QF's ability to design a battery to meet the identified capacity need at the time the contract is executed. So, for example, as staff noted, if the need",

        "text": " Well, it is either us or Pacific Corps. We allow in our joint ownership and operating agreement an interconnection customer to connect to either of us because we each are transmission owners and kind of tenants in common. So that's been our approach there. And we do have quite a few interconnections all across southern Idaho. And yes, I think we're managing probably the vast majority of them, but I think Pacificor does have some in their queue at various stations along the way. Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Appreciate it. Y. Thank you. Yeah. So looking at the cost effectiveness differential, knowing that, that's a really important look to continue to focus on. We have our preferred portfolio of resources, and we ran a no b two h comparison against that preferred portfolio, and so allowed it to optimize around a no b two h or without b two h scenario. And in this case, we found a cost differential of about $836 million in this cycle between a July b two h in service and no b two h whatsoever. And in the gateway west scenario, comparing the without gateway west versus the with Gateway west, we saw a differential there of $580 million. And so in that case, it's really enabling additional renewables or additional resources to be connected to the system rather than kind of forcing resources to be located adjacent to loads. And so that opening up that capability to add a lot of wind and solar, reduce costs substantially associated with Gateway west. Wind, solar out the Snake river plain there. Yeah, along southern Idaho. Snake river plain. That's right. And this includes the full cost of building Gateway west. This includes our one third cost of Gateway west. That makes sense. And then looking at, knowing that, looking at a December b two h is important as well to us and the commission, we looked further at a November b two h. So if we had to put the project in service after the summer of 2026, what change would this incur? And we did see a differential. So getting it in service is definitely earlier, is definitely better, but the differential is pretty manageable at about $21 million. And really, the reason for that smaller differential was because of the VmY coal and natural gas conversion opportunity that we had when we weren't looking at that in prior irps. This differential was quite a bit bigger if there was a b two h timing change. And so y valumy really allows us to fill that gap if b two h moves out beyond July to November in service date or late 2026 and service date. Sorry, what does that 21 million represent? The b two timing differential. Right. So we optimized a portfolio with b two h coming in service in June of 2026 versus b two h coming in service in November of 2026. And that's the differential, is if we miss that in service date window, we have an increased cost of the. Of the November portfolio compared to the junefolio. Your point about the gas or the Valmi is that it doesn't become a reliability issue. Well, what occurs when we delay it is because we have such a large amount of load growth between 2025 and 2026 with those industrial customers is thatn if we couldn't fill that gap with Valmy, we would have had to fill that with a project like batteries or solar plus storage or something like that. A lower cost, it wouldn't be a reliability issue because you'd fill it some other way. But Vol is lower cost way to meet the need created by the delay. That's correct. And we are seeing volumy beneficial regardless of the June or November in service date of b two h. So, so that. Just to make that clear as well. But it really. Yeah, it helps fill that reliability gap. And what would happen if we didn't have something like that? As we would have had to build a lot of resources to meet our 2026 reliability needs. And then you end up kind of long on resources or long on capacity in the ensuing years because b two h adds so much capacity in late 2026. And so you've essentially added this resource in 26, but then, you know, you may not have had a need for it for a few years after that, but 426. And that's part of the reason for a gap that could grow. But with Valy there to help fill that needed, the gap was pretty manageable. The cost differential was pretty manageable. An alternative, then, to keep Valmy running on coal like all of that is predicated on the idea that VM on coal is not an option post 2025 ish. Am I remembering? Nb is. There's a. There's a reason why 2025 was sort of the horizon for Valy Cole. All me running on coal. The plan was to, for both Idaho power and NV energy to shut down the plant from coal operations at the",

        "text": " you know, it turned out that our instinct ended up lining up with what we are seeing in the IRP update, which also says, hey, you need some capacity on your system, you're going to need capacity on your system regardless of what we're seeing in every case we're looking at. And now's the time to go pull the trigger on some of these battery projects to shore up that reliability message here in the near term. So you are taking, what I hear you saying is you are taking some of the types of analyses that we talked about earlier and, you know, prioritizing to the, the most significant reliability sort of trouble spots, correct? Yes. Other, that's all the questions I had on this for right now. I'd love to build on that chair if I could. I understand the, understand what you're articulating I seeing or I'm trying to understand whether I'm seeing a pretty significant reliance on market purchases as you work towards that scale back and narrowly focused deployment of capital. And is that what risk is that creating for customers? Is that a reliable strategy or am I not mean? It certainly appears that there's a significant increase in the market purchases in this IRP update based on you sort of figure 6.15. Are those economic and what risk do those create that they might not be economic given where the WECC is at broadly? So it's, it's there's more market purchases I believe. And I was just trying to find the figure and I didn't want to accidentally close your window, this window. So I stopped looking. I got confused. But relative to the 23 IRP, we do see, you know, some reliance on more on the market there. But the amount of market purchases that we've got in our plan even in the IRP update still remains generally less than what we actually end up, you know, doing when we're setting up our system, particularly when we're hitting those or we see coming in the days weeks ahead, you know, perhaps some extreme weather. You. So we're still below where we can actually go and have been able to go operationally or in, in real day to day environment. But there is certainly some higher. We had so much energy as a replacement coming out of with the OTR and a lot of the resources. Right. I tr to remember twelve to 15,000 wind and solar in five or six years. Seven 8000 battery in that IRP update certainly helped us trim back some of those market purchases. But yes, your observation is correct. There will be some reliance on the market purchases. The hours in which we've seen the biggest challenges for those are exactly in those hours where the batteries will help us not have to procure those products in the day as we're riding through events. And it's why we prioritize our work there. So what we believe that we've got a plan that you addresses reliability and it's doing it in the most cost effective way we can in the environment in which we're operating. But, you know, addressing that those risks and the environment in which we're operating would certainly help us to be, you be able to do have a broader toolkit of things we can do down the road, resource procurement wise, asset development, transmission, investments, et cetera, to help shore that in. I'm trying to say that our plan is not as has more market reliance relative to where we were. It's less than what we actually operate at extreme times. So there's some wiggle room relative to our current operations and we think that's reliable enough. Would we prefer to perhaps do a bit more, maybe not sure that we can't today. So I think we've got a solid plan to shore that up. The battery is going to be huge. Operational teams are very, very excited to have them in the resource plan as we're ring into the summer months, you know, having been through now at least three irps, and follow the various marginal costs of different resources in the mix. I guess what I am struggling with is a concern. I hear you that you are constrained and you are doing the best within the constraints you have. I worry there is a lot of risk in this portfolio around that. We are seeing manifest in power cost cases today around fuel cost volatility, market price volatility, market transaction availability. And I hear you saying you're doing what you can within the constraints you're operating with. And I'm wondering, are we all being sort of as clear and upfront about whether this is a sort of riskier portfolio than you have historically run? I would say the 2021, sorry, 2023 IRP was an area where we started to constrain in the plan in a reasonable timef frame our reliance or ability to buy from the market to achieve our reliability, to meet load reliably, you know, from a planning standpoint, reducing the available market purchases right. In the planning process, we couldn't do that immediately because you can't build a resource in a year of thing, but",

        "text": ". It wasn't about curtailing them. It was about having other resources like battery power or a combination of wind power and solar to just help stabilize the flow of energy onto the transmission lives because of the difficulty in assuming a whole lot of variable energy onto the infrastructure. That was the reference that I was curious about, but it doesn't sound like that is that's going actually impacting the amount of transmission reserve capacity that's being recorded right now. I'm not aware of what you're referring to, so I don't know. Okay, sorry. I guess that's all I have. Thank you. Miss Gilbert, do we have any follow up cross examination for Mister Ellsworth from the parties? Keeping in mind that follow up cross examination should be limited to Mister Ellsworth's responses to Mister Crider and Miss Gilbert that we just heard. If there is a party for anyesting follow up cross examination, please use the raise your hand feature. Now, since I jumped the gun a little quickly earlier, I'll just pause for a moment. And if you are on the phone, it is star six to unmute yourself and see none. Mister Ellsworth, I don't have any questions for you. And, and we do not have any commissioner questions for you either. And so, Miss Rachner, do you have any redirect? No, I don't, your honor. Okay, thank you very much, Mister Ellsworth. Thank you. And so we do find ourselves a little ahead of schedule here. And so I would like to. I think at this point we should move. Our next witness is gonna be a rather lengthy witness, and so we will go to our lunch break. Now we had, I had originally scheduled 45 minutes, but we can extend that to an hour. So let's return at 12:40 p.m. for our afternoon session. We are in recess. Thank you. Thank you. Just a reminder that this session is being recorded and we are here for the evidentiary hearing in PCM five. And we are in the middle of cross examination of witnesses. And our next witness is Mitch Colburnn with Idaho Power. Hello, mister Colburn. And hello, Miss P. Mister colburn, would you please state your name and title and spell your name for the record? Yes, my name is Mitch Colburn. M I t c h c o l b r n. My title is vice president, planning, engineering and construction at Idaho power. Thank you. Mister colburn, do you solemnly affirm that the statements you will be making today are the truth? Yes. Thank you. So today we have two individuals who will be cross examining Mister Colurn. Wendy King will be cross examining Mister Colburn. For approximately 30 minutes. And then Greg Larkin or his representative Irene Gilbert, will be cross examining Mister Colburn for approximately 40 minutes. Jocelyn Pes, his counsel for the witness. Miss King, if you are there, you may proceed. Okay. One of the things I wanted to ask is, is appropriate to do a screen share. I put most of my information in already, and it the troublesome for people to be able to see what we're talking about in the prior testimonies is I think it would be helpful if you're able to screen share to show testimony or exhibits you plan to reference in your cross examination. Oh, it says the host disabled participant screen sharing. Let me check on that. Bear with me for just 1 second. Would that be because I have my stop video selected? Oh, here we go. That was. That was my bad, I thinkk. Yeah, I was just told that we changed the permissions, so. All right, excellent. Okay. So I wanted to preface my cross exam with that. The majority of my questions are going to reference Myers and my mortar farm operations in Morrow County, Oregon, and then the consideration of alternate routes in that area. And so. Hello, Mister Colburnn, nice to meet you. Good afternoon. Just to recap the timeline for the placement of the B two h line in phase four, that line, February 18, 2016, was at a different route, which was north of Myers farm agriculture operations. Then in 2017, in the supplemental sing study, the route was changed over Meers Farm. Is that correct? Your honor, I would object. It. It appears that Miss King is providing testimony here that's outside scope of outside the written record. Thank you for that objection thus far. I think it provides context for the question, but Miss King, please try to keep your commentary limited to the questions. Sure. Yes. So the placement of the route was then over Myers agriculture operations, and then in that second amended project order, and that was issued July 26, 2018. In comparison, Wheat Ridge Energy Facility completed its SAP application in July ",

        "text": "All right. Good afternoon. It is just after 01:30 p.m. on Tuesday, October 17, 2023. My name is Christopher Alwine. I am the administrative law judge assigned to the docket. Please note that this virtual rulemaking event is being recorded. With us today is the chair of the Oregon Public Utility Commission, Megan Decker, and Commissioner Litha Tawney. Thank you for attending. This is a rulemaking hearing for docket number AR 659 in the matter of the Oregon Public Utility Commission's rulemaking to update division 82 small generator Interconnection Rules and division 39 net metering rules in 2007, the commission adopted OAR Chapter 860, division 39, which outlines the commission's net metering policies. The net metering rules include requirements for a net metering project to safely interconnect with utilities system. In 2009, the commission adopted division 82 small generator interconnection rules, which outlines the interconnection requirements, excuse me, for Oregon jurisdictional generators up to 10 mw in size. The informal process for this docket began in June of 2020 via Doc at UM 2111, staff held several workshops with interested persons beginning in February of 2022. The formal rulemaking process, which we're in now commenced via commission order number 23 319, issued following the regular public meeting on August 22, 2023. Staff solicited feedback from interested persons on how to proceed with this investigation. The issues were placed into four different groups at that time. This rulemaking is meant to address items in group one, which staff described in its August 15, 2023 memo as important near term opportunities. Group one issues include screening practices for net metering and small generator projects, export controls to facilitate interconnection of net metering and small generator projects that include storage, the adoption of requirements for export controls, a move to review interconnections based on export capacity instead of nameplate capacity and updates based on IEEE thousand 47 2018, which is a technical standard that establishes how distributed energy resources, or DES, like solar and energy storage, can connect to the grid. In particular, it establishes interconnection requirements for smart inverters, which contain advanced grid support functions that can help the grid accommodate higher levels of renewable energy. The purpose of this rulemaking hearing today is to receive comment from interested persons, docket participants, and members of the public. The objective is to create a robust rulemaking record with fully vetted issues. We will hear oral comments today, and we will take written comments for the record. In this rulemaking, all interested persons and members of the public are invited to provide written comments. Final comments on these proposed rules will be due and must be submitted no later than 03:00 p.m. on Tuesday, November 7, 2023. If you provided comments during the informal phase or prior to August 22, 2023, those are not currently a part of the record. If you would like previously submitted comments to be a part of the record, please file them in the docket after this hearing and before the stated deadline. We note that this rulemaking hearing is a legislative style hearing and there will not be an opportunity for participants to ask questions of each other. We will take comments by calling on one person at a time today, as we just discussed a few minutes ago. We'll probably take it topic by topic, and then we will discuss the topics named in the agenda and finally take comments on other provisions. I may pos questions to those providing comments to seek clarification and gain a better understanding of the comments being made, the commissioners present today may also ask questions of commenters. Participants that provide oral comments today are encouraged to file a written version of their comments on the AR 659 docket prior to the stated due date. Depending on the number of speakers today, the commissioners may be unable to hear all of the comments made, but please keep in mind that we are recording this and that the commissioners will have access to all comments made in writing as well on or before the due date. To maximize our time together, I encourage with the commissioners today, if the point that you we're going to make is made by another speaker, I encourage you to simply highlight it or offer your support and any clarification. And with that, we'll go ahead and begin. And we're going to start with the item on the agenda, technical items, which include advanced inverter equipment requirement dates, high speed rec, clossing equipment requirements, and size threshold for tier one screens. But before I call on Ted Drennin of staff, Greg Adams, do you have a question? Yes, I'm sorry, Judge Alwine, not to have raised this earlier. Could you enable the rename function? I have the wrong name there. I probably cannot, but I'm sure somebody, Diane or Candice may be able to. Oh",

I appreciate you guys having this meeting. Toure us all out. I was born and raised in Clackmas county, and I've been fortunate enough to have power my whole life. I live in a rural area, so that does mean that if I didn't have power, I would also not have water. Sur service because we rely on power to our well to pump water. The power bill has been so expensive lately. We are making cuts left and right. We are doing everything we can to keep our power bill as low as possible. It's been crazy. We've taken out loans to do construction on our home so that we can lower our power bill. And at this time, we're talking about currently for our power bill, entire weeks of income are going to a monthly power bill. I wish that I could go back in time and be involved in the meetings. Last year, I didn't even know about this meeting until today because you guys gave two weeks notice for this meeting. This is. This is not sufficient notice for the life changing changes that you're. That are being proposed here. We can't afford this, and we can't afford to use our own utilities right now. And this increase asks us to shoulder a cost that needs to come from the profits it needs to. This is. This is ridiculous. We don't have any other choice. We don't have anywhere else to get our power from. And I think we should consider whether the industrial customers should, should shoulder this expense since they can afford it. We're talking about companies as opposed to people that would be out of house and home because power is required for housing. And when your power gets cut off, your landlord kicks you out. So you're talking about rendering people homeless to fund a profitable company. As commissioners, it's your job to protect us from this. Please do that. Thank you. Thank you very much. So, we have Nicolai Gallegos, and then we have KB. Hello, can you hear me? Yes, I can. Okay, thank you. Hello. My name is Nicolaiaggo. I am a resident of Clackamas county. And I would just like to",

        "text": " you know, to be the big battery for the system. So, obviously, that's a huge challenge, and none of us probably have the solutions today. But it's a good reminder that as we think about capacity constraints, I think what I'm hearing is capacity constraints are needed even just to relieve the current situation from the tribe's perspective. So really appreciate you making that message clear. Another thought that came to me is I'm just really encouraged to hear that you're reaching out and working with our staff. You know, hopefully, you've been included to some extent. And the efforts that we've been undertaking with respect to equity and the energy transition, I think, you know, we're trying to reach out to new stakeholders and do a better job of listening to diverse interests and understanding how people are really impacted by the system, and recognizing that not everybody, you know, is equally able to access the current system and recognizing that customers are in different situations based on history, you know, and discrimination and wrongdoing. And so one thing that we're focusing on as a commission is trying to figure out how to bring equity into our analyses and how to bring it into our decision making. And so it's really helpful to have a presentation like this that's so clear on what, what you view as important principles that we should be taking into account. And so I guess one thing that we might be considering in the future, that a diversity and equity and inclusion framework that forces us to at least ask before we, we make certain decisions, who's impacted? How are they impacted? What have we done to try to mitigate those impacts? Are those impacts, you know, disparate amongst our customer groups? And so having this kind of presentation, I can already see some of the answers to those questions, you know, that we hopefully could at least ask ourselves, even though the solutions sometimes are difficult, I think step one is to make ourselves ask those questions about what we can do differently or what impacts were causing. So I don't know if, I don't think there's really a question there other than to invite you to correct anything I laid out there or to add to any of that. But I just wanted to thank you for taking the time and giving us such a clear presentation. And I do have a couple other questions, but I don't want to take time from the other commissioners right now, but I'll come back with some questions if we have time. Thank you, Commissioner Thompson. And you've articulated very well our diversity, equity and inclusion framework. And I guess there are. I guess one thing I appreciate about this report is that you're bringing us another lens through which we can view some of the benefits that are brought to us when we're asked to consider energy efficiency and distributed energy resources. One of your recommendations has to do with transparency of Sor cost information. And I guess that's recommendation 37. And I guess I wanted to make sure that I was understanding that the reason that you're wanting that information to be more transparent is that so that the benefits of those things that don't require expansion of the transmission or distribution system, their value appears to be higher. If that's true, then one of the things that we have engaged on is a resource value of solar, or as its's termed today resource value of everything. That integrates some of that cost information into the kind of cost effectiveness threshold or the pricing structure for a program that. By which people can get paid for adding energy efficiency or distributed energy resources. Is that the reason why you're looking for that transparency? And what a system that kind of integrates that information into pricing and cost effectiveness. Cost effectiveness analysis be a form of what you're looking for? I can maybe a couple of things, yes. I think making sure that decisions really factor in the cost of transmission and distribution, along with everything else is critical, because you got to get the electrons to where they're needed, correct? I mean, otherwise it doesn't work. I should have said that the information about transmission costs from the Bonneville Power administration are very accessible. I was able to find them in a few minutes on their website. And in talking to some of the people at Bonneville, I think there are examples where Bonneville actually looked at some transmission expansion and said, there's got to be a less expensive way to move those electrons. And the things like more energy efficiency or other things that your commission'well. Aware of. And that actually resulted in Bonneville deciding not to do some of the expansions because they looked at the cost and then looked at the alternatives and found that there were better ways to proceed. So that's part of it. But the second part is just the transparency. These information, the cost for the investor owned utilities were very hard to find. And I think I ended up at the SEC on form ten h or something, and it was. It was really very convoluted. And I think one of the things that struck me is we've made this presentation in various forums. People are",

        "text": " challenges one of those changes that they don't think is reasonable. The main recommendation we wanted a little bit over, or the main reason we wanted a little bit of oversight is because a lot of these developers rely on these handbooks when they're choosing sites for development or when they're financing projects. And sometimes there's not as much transparency as the developers would like when there's changes and they don't become aware of those until later on in the process, after they've all made all these decisions. And so just having this notice and opportunity to challenge a change if they don't think it's reasonable. So, but if no one challenges it would be the same process as it would be now, where the utilities just update their handbook. Thank you for that. Any other questions for Ellie? Okay, let's go to Jack Watson and then y good afternoon. Chair Decker commissioners TNY and Thompson. For the record, my name is Jack Watson. I'm here today on behalf of the Oregon Solar and Storage Industries association. First, I'd like to thank staff and stakeholders who have participated in this phase one docket. It has been a long process, but all parties were able to reach consensus on the majority of issues. For time's sake, I won't repeat the comments made by Receck or KA, but OA is supportive of those positions. Second, OA is supportive of theort capacity definition included in division 82 and division 39. This tool will encourage flexibility for systems. It could expand the amount of ders thatrect interconnect in certain areas without triggering major upgrades. For that reason, we recommend the same export and nameplate capacity feature added in the commercial space be used for residential NEM projects. It would not result in raising the NEM cap as the export capacity would be set at the current 25 kw limit. Third, OA is supportive of staff's effective date for the compliance with IEEE 1547. If during the formal rulemaking process, the market for compliant equipment becomes more clear, this date could be moved up. Fourth, OCA is supportive of IrEX proposal to resolve the data review and update process. We believe there should be a date certain when this is resolved, and while staff's proposal is nearly there, the threshold for updating feeders should be set at 70% of the relevant minimum load. And lastly, on Commissioner Tawy's question on microgrids from OA'perspective, this is a step in the right direction, but there is a lot more work to be done to enable microids to fully be able to be a commercial product that could be offered. Thank you for the opportunity to comment, and I'll remain on to answer any questions you haveah one quick question for you, Jack. Just to be crystal clear about your proposal around Mem eligibility, you're recommending that the eligibility threshold for tier one interconnection review the increase to match the other customer classes, even though you recognize that residential eligibility for NE, which would be set in a different process, is currently 25 kw? Yeah, that's correct. It's a little bit of a future proofing concept, nonpr preial future proofing. So that way we don't have to come back and make this change then. Okay, thanks. Any other questions for Jack? No? Okay, thanks. Okay, Yoki, go ahead. Hello, can you hear me? Great. My name is Yohi Zakai. I'm with shut Mahal and Weinberger, and I'm here today on behalf of the Interstate Renewable Energy Council or IREEC IREEC is an independent nonprofit working nationally for the rapid adoption of clean energy with a focus on distributed energy resources. We regularly, regularly publish papers on interconnection best practices, working with our electrical engineers to ensure that our recommendations produce safe, reliable, and efficient practices. IRAC was a member of the working group with our attorneys or engineers participating in each workshop and leading the discussion at many I wanted to start off by thanking staff, including TED, for their dedication and hard work through the many, many months of workshops that we had. They really did a great job. I also wanted to thank the utilities for coming to the table with a constructive attitude. Working together, we were able to reach consensus on the vast majority of the rules that incorporates many, many best practices. These interconnection rules represent a significant step forward towards a more accurate and streamlined technical evolution of distributed energy resources. I just wanted to highlight some of the great consensus areas that we hit, and that is to modernize and streamline the screening criteria that are used before a project gets to study. We added a supplemental review process so that projects could make it to approval even if they failed the screens without going to a full study. So kind of an in between step. We're explicitly authorizing the use of energy storage, brid and other non export projects in a technology neutral manner, which should be, as chair Decker mentioned earlier, future proof such that if new technology comes about down",

        "text": "Good morning. Today is May 2, 2023, and we're here for a regular public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. All commissioners are present today, and we will start, as we always do, with an opportunity for public comment on items not listed on the agenda for discussion. I haven't been notified that anyone has public comment, but if anyone does, please, please feel free to unmute yourself and introduce yourself. All right, not seeing anyone. We have a short consent agenda today. Good morning, chair. I move that we adopt a staff recommendation as set forth in each memo for each chat in that's on the consent agenda. And good morning, chair. This is Commissioner Tani, and I second that. I concur. The motion carries and the consent agenda is adopted. I'm just going to give a quick description of our agenda here today. We'll start with Idaho Power Company'transportation electrification plan, and then we have regular agenda item two, which is sort of an update to the commission on the multi state protocol which the stipulating parties have requested to extend the 2020 protocol. So we'll hear about that, and then we have sort of an information only briefing on Pacific powers participation in extended day ahead market. And I just wanted to assure those giving that presentation who I know have a commitment that they need to get to that will make sure to cut to the third item, the extended day ahead market presentation, no later than 11:00 Pacific. We may get there much earlier, but I just wanted to let everyone know I'm attuned to your schedule and we'll make it work with that. Let's bring up Eric Schireman for regular agenda item number one, the transportation electrification plan. Good morning, chair Decker, Commissioner Tanei and commissioner Thompson. My name is Eric Schireman. I'm a senior utility analyst in the Energy resources and Planning division. I'm joined by Betsy Bridge and assistant attorney general with the Oregon Department of Justice and representatives of ideal power that will be presenting the company's transportation electrification plan for 2023 through 2025. After this brief summary of staff's recommendation, staff recommends the commission accept Idaho Powerste Plan. The company has met the requirements of the new division 87 rules, and in accordance with those new rules, commission acceptance of Idaho powers Te plan will approve a three year TE budget. The company proposes to fund a sustained electric vehicle outreach and education program in its Oregon service territory for the next three years with an annual budget of approximately $15,000. Staff finds the company's proposed budget reasonable within the context of Idaho Power's assessment of charging infrastructure, need reporting of performance metrics, and analysis of this budget's benefit and costs. That concludes staff's summary of our recommendation. Jesse Brady of Vial Power will now introduce the company's Te planning team for a presentation of the 2023 through 2025 Te plan. Staff can answer any questions that Commissioner may have for us after Idah Power has finished presenting. Great. Thanks, Eric, and welcome, Jesse. Awesome. Thank you, Eric. Good morning, Tereckker. Commissioner, Tony. Commissioner Thompson, thanks for the opportunity to present this morning. I really wanted to quickly also introduce Patty best, and I'll let Pati introduce herself. Between the two of us, we will ll be walking through the company's transportation electication plan. So, Patty, do you want to introduce yourself really quickly? Sure. Good morning, commissioners. My name is Patty Best. I am the senior program specialist here at Idaho Power, focusing on transportation, electrification. Awesome. Thanks, Paty. If you want to go to the next slide. Okay, so just walking through kind of the format of the presentation today, we'll start with just a general overview of Idaho Powers Oregon service area, including the market barriers we discussed in the plan, and then just the general state of the te market, the in the region of eastern Oregon, kind of including the overall awareness of electric vehicles and perception as well. We'll then jump into the company's ev forecast and the needs assessment analysis performed using ODOT's Tina tool and how that has informed an investment guardrail and infrastructure. And then Patty will walk us through the company's Te plan, as well as the performance metrics that we'll use to measure that plan. And then lastly, we'll walk through the Te budget customer impact, and we will conclude and answer any questions you guys have. Next slide, please. Okay, so the company's Oregon service area is kind of that chunk highlighted in green in eastern Oregon. It's made up of about 20,000 total customers, about 14,000 of which are residential. And it's almost completely defined as underserved, either rural or frontier. According to HB 2165, the largest towns in the service area are Ontario, Nissa, and Bail, Ontario being about 11,600 people. And the closest urban",

        "text": " moments. Um, there have been a number of changes that are significant and that my colleagues are going to walk through in detail. But before going into those, I do just want to highlight three themes and a final takeaway. The first theme of this IRP is load growth are we continue to be a company that has experienced tremendous growth. We've announced several large customer additions, and on average, we're expecting our demand to grow by about 80 year over the 20 years of the IRP time horizon. And that certainly sheds light on the second point, which is the absolute necessity of transmission to our system and to serving our customers in this preferred portfolio of the 2023 IRP. Boardman to Hemingway continues to show up as, as the least cost option, as does three segments of Gateway west. So we're really seeing the essential nature of transmission pickup in our preferred portfolio showing itself as a least cost, least risk option. And finally, we're really seeing our emissions trajectory take a steady and significant downward decline that's in part due to exiting coal by 2030 and the addition of about 5000 clean resources over the time horizon, as well as 1500 ish megawatts of storage and of course, more transmission that is connecting us to an ever cleaner west. And then finally, I think the, the encapsulating point I'd like to make is that how we've approached this IRP? Two words really sum it up. Flexibility and adaptability. As we're managing the growth that we are experiencing and that we're planning for, there are a lot of on the ground decisions, real time and near term, that may look different or be on a different pace than what has shown up in the preferred portfolio. And we will endeavor to communicate changes as we know them, when we know them. But there is a tremendous amount of consistency in what we're seeing with our preferred portfolio. And that's the, again, the essential nature of transmission, the transition to planar resources, and that will growth. So with that, I'd love to hand it over to my colleague Jared Hanseson. And I ask one question before you do thatute, and because I suspect that this isn't necessarily part of the IRP, and as we're talking about the context, I'm curious to just, and it's fine if you can't speak to this, but the essential nature of transmission, transmission connects you to different markets. And then there's a question sitting out there about the market future that creates some uncertainty in planning and expectation for what exactly the transmission that you develop connects you to. How would you encourage people to manage with that uncertainty as we review your IEP? That is a great question, and it is a big point of uncertainty with respect to this particular IRP. As a company, we are assessing whether market entrance and which market would be appropriate for our company as a result of simply not knowing that, having not finished that assessment, we didn't factor in or attempt to model a market or markets in this IRP. But we certainly recognize that's something that we'll need to factor in in the future, maybe market light. We did find a way to capture the western resource adequacy program, and so that is an addition to thisp. And we'd be happy to talk about how we modeld that in detail. But I think it's that sort of creative modeling that we approached rap with, that we would apply that same sort of thinking into how eventually we would attempt to model the impact of a market on our IRP. Okay, thanks. Appreciate that sort of framing. All right. All right, so, Jared Hansen, you're up, and I'll just finally note that we would love to answer any questions or throughout. Thank you. Good news. Thank you, Allison. Chair Decker. Commissioner Taney, it's good to see you again. It's been a little while. I'm going to go ahead and start sharing my screen. All right. Let me know if that's coming through. Okay. You may wish to put it in, like, presentation mode or. There we go. Yep. O good. That's exactly what I wish to do. All right, well, we're excited to present on this fine Halloween Day on our 2023 IRP and the results from that one. You know, we. We took some time to develop it. We met with our advisory council about a dozen times to just discuss our inputs and share feedback on each, or to take feedback on all of those, as well as the methodologies that we employed. And here is a flowch chart showing our current IRP development process. What I'm really hoping to illustrate here and to see if I can get a good pointer. All right, looks like it's working. Is that this long term capacity expansion process in Aurora is only part of our process, really. We have a reliability tool that we use to calibrate inputs prior to running that model, and then we use those, that same tool on",

        "text": ", invite JP Botmaol for PUC staff to come on up and get us started. Thanks. Thank you, chair doctor. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Commissionerani. For the record, my name is JP Vall. I'm the division administrator for PUC's energy resources and planning group and I'm representing staff here today. With me today, also from DOJ, is our assistant attorney general, Joanna Riemanneider, along with the great crew from PUC who were instrumental in our comments. Before we get started, I'd like to just thank all the stakeholders. SIP Corps. I don't know if I'll do as eloquent J as Sud suggesta did in LC 80, but this was truly a group effort and I really appreciate everyone coming together the way they did. We're not all on the same page, but I think everyone is doing their best working here together. There was a lot of curveballs outside of the IRP process that put us where we are today. I just really appreciate how woman's leadaning it around this monumental task as you try to navigate the first IRP CEP during rapidly changing time for Pacific Core, I will attempt to keep my presentation relatively brief given the time constraints I've broken into the following parts. We'll talk about the decision for us today, what staff'laid out, why we're here now and not in April. Talk a little about CEP process going forward. And then finally, just a real quick tidbit on the small scale renewable rfP, which we included in our memo, and just kind of an explanation behind that and why we're hoping to wrap that a little bit into the discussion today. Of course, myself and staff and joanna all be here available for questions afterwards if you need anything. So with that said again, I'm trying to keep it under ten minutes. So here we go. So why are we here now? This decision for us today, I think just taking a step back, we had three massive, really two massive changes that outside of the IRP, that led to one, the suspension of the 2022 all source rfP. The suspension as we understand it right now, the proposed 2024 all sots RFP, and then some of the actions, most notably around the selective non catalytic reduction technology in a few of the coal plants due to the stay of the OTR, the ozone transport rulerry. What those did was those created a pretty massive hole. We it talked about it in our memo. I have slides if we needed, just for visually showing it. But the preferred portfolio was bringing forth an aggressive and really an amazing amount of renewables, wind, solar and associated battery storage, about 15 gigawatts by 2028, after the RFP and after suspensions. And what happened in September following the May filing was we saw that reduced from 15 to six. So 15 gigawatts down to six gigawatts. And that was really the bulk of what was supposed to happen in 2028. So nine gigawatts taken off the table, which left us a little bit up in the air as to what exactly the perherred portfolio was, what the action plan was pointing us towards. And as you guys grappled with an LC 80, what visibility were we having into the future around the plans of the company and how those related towards House Hospital 2021. So when we approached the company in our first round of comments in December, us other stakeholders, and I would note stakeholders in other states also brought up the same thing, which is can we revise the IRP? The company came back and said that they wanted to focus on the IRP update. Things were moving quickly. The proper place for this were several assurances about the action plan preferred portfolio, what resource acquisitions could possibly take place in the future, what could be forthcoming in the IRP update. Rather than go through what we had put in staff and Talkac with stakeholders and we decided it was better just to try and ended in February rather than go to April and just work with the IRP update. We figured what we could do is some ensure some minor revisions of the IRP update to position a revised CEP for acknowledgement. That was it. The theme around staff'recommendations, I think I don't want to tutor harm, but I think was flexibility in the IRP. We suck to acknowledge what we could. There are things that we couldn't acknowledge, but for the most part we tried to pick out parts that we thought were like this is actually workable, the whole thing doesn't need to go out. We sought to build in the IRP update the bare minimum of elements that would need to be adjusted and fixed so that we could assess CEP acknowledgeability. And just again, taking a step back. The CEP and the way Pacific Corps has formulated this is utter reliant on the IRP's preferred portfolio and action plan. They cannot",

        "text": " I don't see anything that would cause issue with proceeding forward now. I think the handbook changes if we need to change the process there, that can be updated in the rules. So, so I don't think there are any impediments at this point. Any comments, Stephanie, from you on that question that would differ in any way? Sure. Ducker? I agree with Ted that the rulemaking would be sufficiently broad to allow the commission to adopt and, or address any issues that might come out during for rulemaking. Okay. Thanks. Ok. With that sort of recognition of where we are in the process, sometimes it is still something that people want to argue that the commission should begin with a different proposal. I understand that it is, however, both late in the day. We have some time for this. It's late in the day, but it's also early in the process. So definitely open to hearing what comments people have and what questions commissioners have about the issues that are still open but just want to make sure that we're, I guess, understanding why we'd be taking up a particular important substantive issue, whether it's because the commission feels strongly that this is the direction they're leaning. And so they want to make that clear in the rulemaking proposal, but it wouldn't be, at least based on what I've heard here, that we couldn't consider it going forward. I have one substantive question, notwithstanding what I just said about, but I want to open it to the other commissioners for any questions for Ted, before we get going, I have a high level question. You talked in your opening about resilience and so on, and, you know, this is question for you, but also for the commenters that I presume get is sort of how far down the field does this move us towards that resilience vision of islanding microgrids and sort of the things that people talk about, the things we see federal money theoretically pointed to and how much more transformation needs to happen versus how much more transformation needs to happen. So in the broad scheme of things, sort of how far down the modernization pathway does this get us? Thanks. That's a good question, and I'm not sure I can fully answer it just because there are so many different things that will need to be updated. I think this gets us a good way down the line. It helps to enable stuff like storage, which we're focusing now on export capacity. In the past, it was nameplay, and there the storage could be added to the generating facility. And so this basically doubles what could be allowed behind the meter, and then the protections will keep that to whatever. You know, if it could be for tier one, it could be 50 megawatt facility with 25 export capacity. Kilowatt. Kilowatt, not megawatts. Sorry. Sorry. Okay. Yeah. And so, and I think when we, when we spoke, when we scoped this out, the investigation, we tried to get the things that would be the most important, that would help parties the most first. And so that's where we, where we went and through the process, we've realized there are s some other areas where we should address potentially next. So we'll probably do a similar process with pinging the stakeholders and seeing what will help before we proceed with phase two. You know, we have four or five phases in this in total, so it's going to be a while, but we're trying to, trying to address the larger issues first. Okay. Okay. So what I'm hearing is we're addressing the material issues that are holding us back right now, but there's iterative work to keep doing and you're thinking about how to take into account what you've already learned to keep us moving down that track. Okay, thanks. I don't have substantive questions about the actual rules. They seempar. Please. I don't really have questions either. I think the one question I had was along the lines of what you asked about chair, which was for any reason, kind of legally, we can't move forward to the formal stage now. And my twist on that question was just, I want to recognize, Ted, that I know you've done a ton of work to be able to facilitate these conversations and to get parties to come together. That, that's not easy. And, you know, you thank the parties for their cooperation. Thank you for leading that and all the effort. And I guess the, the question I had was, is there anything from your perspective, you. I want to keep taking advantage of opportunities for the parties to come together if they can, and you've been leading that effort. Is there anything from your perspective that would change the dynamic or the vibe of those conversations and just make it much less likely that we're going to make progress going forward if we went to the formal rulemaking? That was the question I had. I heard you answer the chair. It's question pretty broadly and saying, you know, you",

        "text": " There's been, I think, an overestimation of what Bonneville timelines can be achievable relative to what is actually achievable. You know, project being in study status doesn't mean it's going to get conditional firm. It doesn't mean anything really. It could mean that there's a billion dollar project that will never beb built. There's projects that have been in the queue and. And study status for 1015 years, waiting for a fourth enterise circuit. So some of PG's assumptions about what transmission is eligible to occur and what they're assuming is gonna be CF versus firm aren't really anchored in how that stuff actually works. So I wanted to flag that, which I think is to say that it's a more constrained environment. I will say in terms of meaning, let me understand you. Meaning that the minimums should. Should in fact be stricter. There are assumptions of the transmission that's awardable or higher than is in reality. Like it's worse than they're telling you in terms of what transmission can be delivered to their system. I'm just looking for the implication for the RFP, I guess. I think. Well, as it relates to clean energy plans and the RFP, it what is awardable and who can be bid, who can bid, they're going to end up pre filtering more people that aren actually going to be able to achieve those results. So with their, they're showing certain things in the CEP that expects the more expansive universe. But if you're limiting to who can bid, the relationship of who's going to get awards when or doesn't is going to be artificially constrained. Whereas if you had no, you know, you're go goingna end up with a smaller universe than you should. Whererasus. If you had no long term fir requirements at all, you would have a different set of bidders. And you might see all of those things and somebody might be able to deliver a lot of power on hourly firm or get half of nameplate and deliver the rest. So the constraints that, or the lines that they're drawing aren't as effective as they think they are in getting sort of real viable near term projects. Is that the implication of what you're saying? I think the bidding requirements on the firmness are going to constrain the number of bids in terms of the clean energy plans and roadmaps of what they can achieve by what timelines we're going to have over assumptions of what is achievable relative to what is dependent upon new cross cascades transmission lines, which would be my sort of second point about that, which is, as we're looking at timelines and assumptions, the, I guess part of what I'm trying to see here is long term firm is an extremely precious commodity and is extremely constrained. And if we overuttilize and over consume it for RFP bids by requiring 100% nameplate, like if you required 50% instead of 100%, there's literally twice as much transmission available. There's more transmission available on the system in the short term market, because transmission lines are rated for the worst day of the year, they're rated for August at 05:00 p.m. right. So the rest of the year, there's a lot more transmission. For example, generally, the constraints on the transmission bid requirements, the moes that are being established here, or the years of Portland saying we have to have 100% nameplate, long term firm, or this new conditional firm variant on it, those are constraining who can bid. The biggest solar project in the state right now is the obsidian project. They can't bid. They're categorically removed from this. You will never see what it would cost for them to get to Portland general because it will be invisible in this solicitation. Does that make sense? Okay, anything else on this topic or follow up questions for Jake? The one thing I will say on transmission, and just in terms of the scope of RFP, I think there's a solid thousand megawatts that can be built by 25 in the market today that can be energized, if not substantially more than that. And just as we're framing like, what is the art of the achievable? You know, probably twice that with batteries. But as you're thinking about what can be done, you know, my experience, having been in interconnections started in 20, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21-2223, and in every TP exc except one in that time period, is. That's about what is, you know, a minimum achievable. It's about 1000 mw, can be built by 25. Not that you shouldn't consider dates longer than that. Thanks. Great, thank you. Okay, let's go to Irene Sanger. Thank you, chair Deckker. Good afternoon, Chair Decker, Commissioners Thompson and Tommy. I'm going to be quick on this issue. Appreciate the question that Mark Thompson asked about the impact of the later cods. That was",

        "text": " questions for Chris? Miss is Kevin Higgins again. I guess I would ask if your work papers could be made available as well as your presentation. Yeah, I was going to check. I know when we file, we. When we filed, we provided them to people that had signed the protective order, but I can't remember now if we provided them via huddle or if they got provided just to the PUC and they haven't been pushed out to stakeholders yet. But I'll check on that after this meeting. Thank you. I have a question. I wonder if you could provide maybe a high level answer. I was looking at the schedule 201 renewable fixed price option for the solar Pl storage QF, and I see that the prices are the same in every month and during the deficiency period. And I think, you know, I'm generally used to seeing those kind of vary over the course of the year. And so I'm just curious what it is about the way PGE has calculated the rates that is making it do that. I'm looking at tables eight, a and e b. I can take that. Chris, you want me to. Yes, please, Jimmy. Okay. Yeah. That's your correct observation. And the reason you don't see that month to month difference is that the forward market prices are not being used in the solar storage tariff to. As factors to modify the monthly payments. Just by way of background, the existing solar avoided cost structure uses forward on peak and off peak, you know, traded market prices to arrive at factors that adjust the monthly on 16 hours on peak and off peak periods of time within the solar tariff. And with the solar storage tariff, that obviously we're moving to a four hour key construct rather than the WEC wide on peak construct. And so there doesn't exist a forward market price to perform that same factoring technique. And so we did not do that in this for the solar storage filing. Okay, thank you. I have one more question. It's probably for all three of the utilities, but I haven't taken a look yet at the red line of the PPA that each of you provided, but I am wondering if we could get an answer on sort of at a high level, what you all felt was needed to be changed in the PPA because, as I understood staff, one of the reasons staff wanted to use the approach that was adopted was because it wouldn't require changes to the power purchase agreements. Mar, this is Jordan. I'm happy to take that question and I can walk through the PPA changes if you like. There's very few of them. Just to clarify, in the staff memo that was adopted, the utilities were invited to propose changes to the PPA that they felt were necessary. But like staff, we did not think that a ton of changes were necessary. Would it be helpful for me to walk through those or have you had a chance to take a look? I haven't even looked at it yet. So, I mean, I don't want to get into like too big of the weeds, but just maybe at a high level, if you could let us know what you thought was necessary. Sure. So in the recitals. Well, maybe I should just share. This is the red line and all three utilities file the same one in the recitals rather than. If we had been doing a storage only PPA, we probably would have rephrased this first recital so that some of the references to generating facility more explicitly incorporated storage as well. But rather than doing that, since this PPA applies to all resource types, we just added a reference to as more fully described in exhibit b. Then we expanded exhibit b so that there's more description of the generating component separate from the storage component. In a couple places, like in the definite, there were a couple places where we felt like we needed to be explicit that storage capability of the facility was included. This definition is one of those places. Another change that you'll see here in the off peak and on peak hours definition is we needed to account for the fact that we have a different four hour peak. So rather than adding separate definitions of premium peak hours, we just defined off peak and on peak hours so that they correspond with the appropriate premium or not premium hours for solar plus storage. Here in this section about this is about oh, this is the default section. We needed to be clear that if someone fails to continue meeting the eligibility requirements for a standard PPA or for standard pricing as set forth in the schedule, then that would be an event of default. We felt that was particularly important here with solar plus storage because we do have really specific eligibility criteria to get these standard prices. Then here is the exhibit. As I mentioned, we have included more detail about the generating facility to make sure that the utility can understand how that is set up and how, and then have added a section about the storage facility. Then the last",

        "text": " have exceptions for firm transmission for under twelve month periods. And something that's important to recognize is that not everyone is in the room for some of the decisions made with respect to transmission and not everyone has both the load and the customers serve. We need to make sure that that utilities with market power don't force purchase of a year of transmission when the actual timef frme that we need to cover is just eight months over the course of a period. I know people understand that that's in front of the perke, but we did want to indicate to this commission that the fact that we have a limited issue in front of Birke is not in any way suggestion that we aren't fully committed to the regional plan. The second comment I want to make has with a discussion that we've just had with respect to the forward showings by the Esses. We do have a very different portfolio than the utilities. We do not necessarily have customers three year or five years out in advance. We are concerned with the showing gap. We are happy to project, but it is non workable in my mind for us to be able to commit to a five year year firm plan or research adequacy when we do not have a five year guaranteed customer or recovery. We believe that a regional approach such as what is going on under the wrap is the best approach and the same reasons that Rapp has proposed their seven month showing and KAiU has done it. We think that is something the commission should adop. And again, we are happy to project. We just believe that there needs to be some recognition that as ESS is requiring something beyond the long term projection is probably not workable for us and I'll stop there. We're happy to provide further written comments and continue to participate in the program. Thanks Carl. I appreciate the breity of your comments and really highlighting for us what your, your most significant concerns are. And I'm sure that in no way limits what you may want to talk about as certainly the PUCC process goes forward. Let's go then to Mike wilding for Pacificorp. Hi, good afternoon. Really appreciate the time. I appreciate you putting on this workshop. Obviously this RA subject is very important for or not only Oregon, but the region. And we're facing some challenges. And because of those challenges, the regional coordination we feel is very important. And because of that, Pacific Corp has been participating in the WRP development and also the Edam stakeholder process. We've recently announced that we will be participating in both of those and looking to move both of those programs, both the RAP and EdaM forward to go live and implementation there and at the same time were supportive of Oregon havingn its own RA standard. Our position and what we feel is that participation in a regional RA program should feel like the WRP that is being developed and moving into that next binding phase should provide that compliance for any entity that participates for the Oregon RA standard and that any reporting, any filing requirements that come along should be consistent as well with the Wrap. And we do have some concerns about the requirement for a two to three year plan for us. I appreciated Commissioner Taneis question regarding the IR IRP would be that two to three year plan and then additional concerns of forcing or requiring procurement that far in advance. And we heard Rebecca talk about concerns such as market liquidity. Most of the market activity and the ability to procure forward transactions is within that twelve month period. And so having a plan two to three years out and IRP for ious or the equivalent or some sort of equivalent report for ESS, we're supportive of that. But we think instead of having that procurement requirement beyond what the RAP program has, we should continue to increase regional coordination and diversity benefit of these larger regional programs as opposed to adding those costs to customers for that forward procurement which can be taken care of on that shorter time frme so I think that's all I got. I want to keep it brief and really appreciate this whole workshop and the opportunity. Make a few comments. Appreciate that. And again, it's good to hear just top level what people are thinking about in this space. So thanks for sticking around and giving us that. Thanks. Okay, so next was Greg Adams for Calpine Energy solutions. King me chair. Doctor, I sure can go ahead. Yeah. Okay, good. Sorry. Yeah. Greg Adams for Caline Energy Solutions. Thank you chair Decker and commissioners Tany and Thompson for the opportunity to speak to this issue today. Calpine Solutions supports the regional resource adequacy efforts and staff efforts to develop an Oregon specific resource adequacy program which we've been actively engaged in. We submitted some detailed written comments on the latest straw proposal. I don't know if you had a chance to review this, but there's quite a bit of detail there that we look forward to working through with staff and the other stakeholders in the program you're looking at putting together. I think we generally agree with the comments Carl thinkink",

        "text": " that calculation would look like in staff's view and the rationale behind it. That is a good question. I mean, we are seeking to establish and avoided deliverability cost here and wanting to ground truth this in a process with good engagement, hence looking toward the IRP process. And I guess maybe is the idea. I mean, as I read it, what I'm seeing is you take, would you take every transmission project in the IRP and assume that every transmission project is going to be avoided by virtue of a QF? And so you'd give a QF Ango organ a slice of the avoided transmission build out. So maybe. Or is it supposed to be more targeted at a QF in a particular location would be attributed some avoided transmission in the vicinity of that QF? Or. And is there any sort of tie, you know, a causation sort of tie between an actual QF enabling an avoidance of a transmission build out, or are we just assuming buildouts won't happen if we get sufficient qs? Sorry, that's a lot of questions, but I'm just trying to get a better sense of where, what exactly this would look like. Because as it's written, it sounds like it could be a pretty significant issue. And I don't know if it's intended to be as broad as I'm understanding it. I will say I appreciate you asking these questions, because it's difficult to contemplate everything fulsomely in abstraction, and we can grapple with it in more detail as we continue. I don't know that I have any clear answers for you toward that end right now. Dan, I see your hand up. So this is Dan McNeil for Pacificre and kind of to get to some of what Adam may have been getting to, you know, you identified battery as a capacity resource and maybe wind as an energy resource. And one of the principles back in, um, 2011 that was identified by e three who assisted on that was that, you know, the capacity cost should be based on the net costs of the resource, ed addition that might be needed to be added for capacity. So a battery dispatches and charges and discharges and creates revenue requirement benefits as it operates throughout the year that defray some portion of its cost. And so it's not the whole cost of that battery that you need for capacity. That's not what we would ask customers for in revenue requirement. It's only the incremental costs in excess of the benefits it provides. And so you could do that with a battery and so on, but you'd have to figure out what those benefits are and some track them off. The same thing is true for the wind. I mean, wind resources provide capacity. Seems to be a tenant of what you're proposing here. If you pay out the entire cost of a wind resource without regard for the capacity benefits it's providing, the energy costs are going to be overstated for that same reason. And once you put energy in, once you try and identify what the energy cost is for a battery, what the energy cost is for wind, what it is for solar, you know, you risk getting right back to, you need a production cost model to identify what all those energy values are and how they are important. I didn't see that in this proposal. You know, that net cost aspect and know for the transmission, as Adam was saying, if we're going to build the transmission line and it reduces congestion, that's an energy benefit that benefits to the system that is lost in the absence of that transmission. And so it's not the cost of that transmission, it's probably just the net cost. And if it's also required for reliability and other reasons, it's unavoidable. You know, that's a pretty gray area, generally speaking. But, you know, the idea that we could identify specific costs that are strictly related to the interconnection of a proxy resource, maybe, and, you know, within some degree of certainty, sure. But the idea that there are other benefits beyond these costs that defray what we actually have to charge to customers and that you accounted for in the avoided cost would just like flag that out there. Best practice for like net cost of capacity and so on. Really appreciate those comments. Stan Ryan, if it's helpful. This is Carolyine. I could just, you know, step back and speak to including that in our proposal. I think looking back to if folks remember Docket 2032, where we're looking at network resource issues, there were questions raised there where we wanted to make sure time back to that, that we posed to the group as a potential issue in this investigation, whether there was a methodological need to reflect the avoided deliverability costs differently than we have in the past, or at least make sure that whatever the avoided deliverability costs are in the avoided resource are reflecting the constraints that get flagged in planning conversations, for example, in the modern landscape. So we put something out there to spur conversation, and",

And so, you know, she'll be helping to drive research as well as what she's doing with the Department of Energy. So it's very exciting time for us. I think PGE is seen as a leader in this space. We want to continue to do that. Mister n Ty. I would add that on everything that we've done over the last five years, we've begun to see the investments of that foundation that we have laid. While we still have some more systems and additional foundation, we're now at a point where we can really begin to scale with customer sided resources. And probably better lucky than good that our federal government has come in and stepped in with tremendous support for solar panels, battery storage in people's homes, electric vehicles. We're at a very fortunate period of time with an energy and a transactive platform that should allow us to reach those carbon goals that Kristen was talking about in a reliable and an affordable fashion. Thanks for that. And I know that, I appreciate the way you're thinking about bringing all the planning together. Certainly we see the OR, I see the interface between DSP and IRP rate, the iterative flow there. I did wonder about the workforce and safety slide, and this is something we have talked about over the years. I see the really significant improvements, which I want to appreciate. I know how hard the workforce has been working to make that happen and that, you know, I can see that management is prioritizing it in a way that is different than a few years ago. I am curious, though, re, you know, compared to your peers, still not sort of top of the heap. And I'm curious how you're thinking about moving forward, how you'going to go after those next pieces, particularly given that the working conditions perhaps is part of whats changing and making this hard. Right. But the system is, the system has an impact on the workforce, and trying to limit that impact is an important piece of the puzzle. Sure. So you're absolutely right. Well, first of all, we have been on a safety journey, and we continue to be on that journey. This past year, we saw an uptick in ocean recordables. And at the tail end of the year in particular, when you talk about conditions, it was flying limbs during all of those heavy winds that caused a number of incidents and nobody was significantly hurt. But we certainly did have recordables. One of the things that I continue to be encouraged by is that even though our recordables went up, which was consistent with trends across the utility industry and in other industries in 2022, our significant issues continue to go down. So that lost time rate where someone is hurt to the extent that they need to leave the workplace, that continues its downwards trend. We're really working at this next level on proactive policies and procedures. This past year, we redid our entire safety manual in conjunction with all of our frontline coworkers. And so we have that new document that we collectively put together. It isn't our document, it isn't the union document. It's all of our document together as a basis to start this year. And then we're doing a lot more case management that is very typical of every industry and other utilities that they do much more active case management than we have done. And so we're advancing our nurse first program to be a much more comprehensive program and working, and we're about, just about to kick it off. So I think you'll begin to see that as sort of the next step in our maturity. But I don't think you we will ever stop having safety is our highest priority and key focus. We appreciate that and thank you. Thank you, chair. Thanks for the good questions, colleagues. I have one that builds, I think, on a couple of the questions that you just answered and it kind of puts them together. So with things that you've done for a long time, like measure OSHA recordable incidents, you have a really good, solid system for tracking your performance and the cold, hard outcomes that you're getting. I think that exists for the safety incidents. I hear you talk about it with some of the operational improvements that your teams are making in the field in terms of their efficiency of getting to things. I wonder how you're thinking about that need to understand sor, how you're doing and what outcomes you're producing in some of the new areas where metrics maybe aren't as developed. And I don't mean this question really specifically. I think there are specific examples I could give, like how are you examining your performance within major events that are sometimes excluded from those traditional sadie and safety measures? But just generally speaking, when you're talking, Larry, about new investments to drive interactivity, benefits in the distribution system, how do you approach performance and outcomes within your company on",

        "text": "Good afternoon. Today's June 7, 2023, and we're here for a special public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. We're here for a follow up meeting in, um, 22 55, which is Idaho powers all source RFP. We conducted a public meeting on this on May 16, and as explained in the staff memo for today's meeting, there were some scheduling issues. That meant there were a few other recommendations from independent evaluator that we needed to take up. And we scheduled this time for that meeting because we know that Idaho Power has a need for procurement and we want to help them get these things resolved and get this out the door. I do want to, before I invite staff up to kick us off here, want to note that I do intend for us to conduct today like we would a regular public meeting item where we hear from staff and then hear from other the company and others said want to comment and that we get to our resolution of this issue today. I note in Idaho Powers comments a request that we get this buttoned up today because of their need to begin procurement. And I think we hear that and are prepared to get to resolution today, even though lots of these issues, like many others we deal with, talk about for a long time. But let's try to efficiently wrap this one up today. So, commissioners, anything else you want to say by way of introduction before I invite Pat Shaughnessy up? Ok, Pat, Patrick, why don't you come on up for PC staff? And thanks for the continued good work on sorting out these issues for us in the memo. I know there's been some written comments back and so if you can help us figure out where we stand and what we have to do here today, that would be great. Absolutely. Thank you very much. Chair Decker. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, commissioners Ti and Thompson. For the record, my name is Pat Shaughnessy with OPUC staff, and I'm joined today by staff Coun council Joanna Remman Schneider. I'm here today to discuss staff's recommendations, including supplemental recommendations concerning Idaho powers application for approval of its 2026 all source request for proposals and the associated scoring and modeling methodology. We're also joined today by Len Trinidad and other members of the team from London Economics, the independent evaluator for this procurement, who will be prepared to discuss their own reports or to answer any questions. Staff's been very, very appreciative OFIs diligent work on this procurement thus far as the LEI team has made many suggestions and recommendations throughout this process that we think will lead to a more transparent and competitive procurement. Staff would also like to thank stakeholders, and Nipsey in particular, for their thoughtful engagement throughout this process. Many of the recommendations and conditions across the two staff reports on this RFP were drawn from input provided by Nipsey and staff believefs. Those recommendations have resulted in a much more competitively sound RFP. And finally, staff would also like to thank the team at Idaho Power for working so cooperatively with stakeholders, staff and with the independent evaluator. They've been very transparent, responsive to inquiries and, you know, recommendations from staff and the IE throughout the process. So at this point, chair Decker, I thought I'd recap the discussion from the May 16 public meeting briefly before moving on to supplemental recommendations made in staff report from last week. But I'm prepared to sort of forego that recap if you'd like to move directly to new issues. Yeah, I think we've had, I'm sure, had a chance to read all the memos and comments and things. So I think what would be most helpful is to give us start with a rundown of what you perceive remains outstanding and necessary for us to decide today. Thank you, chair Decker. Absolutely. So I think to sort of recap what I think are the only two outstanding issues that were recommendations in the original staff report for the May 16 meeting. You know, that report contained ten conditions for RFP approval, eight of which were adopted by the company ahead of that meeting. And at the meeting, the commission heard from both IPC and stakeholders and staff, obviously on the two outstanding issues, which were the included inclusion of an imputed debt adder into the price scores for bids and language in section eight of the form contracts, stealing with the right of first offer and ownership or purchase options. The commission discussed the issue of imputed debt at length at the public meeting on May 16. So in the interest of time, staff doesn't have any additional comments to make on that topic, though I'm obviously happy to answer any questions if there are any. The other outstanding issue, you know, staff continues to recommend the removal of the provision in sect. Section eight of the PPA and BSA form contracts dealing with negotiation of facility purchases.

And so we've been advancing ourselves and looking at our project management teams and how they operate and make sure that we're executing on those in a timely fashion. And, you know, I will just say our performance in years past wasn't as good as it could be. And so we're moving, advancing that way so we can do more capital, in fact, if we're executing better and doing the right things. So it is an evolving process. But I'm really proud to say, you know, how we've evolved with both the transmission, the distribution generation, our customer work, grid modernization, and even our facilities as we think about trying to upgrade where our crews are and their line centers, where our call centers and how they're operating, lots and lots of benefits that we can make ourselves efficient. And in the end, the customer experience is much better. All right. Thanks for that, colleagues. Any other questions for the company before we, I think, turn it back for a conclusion? Okay, back to you. I think you had another slide or two. Okay. Well, thank you very much, chair deckers and commissioner Thompson and Tawi. We really appreciate your time and the great questions. We look forward to continuing the dialogue. In summary, our priorities for 2023 will be to continue to decarbonize, electrify and perform. You can expect us to make investments that deliver long term value in driving to a reliable and resilient grid and a robust virtual power plant, to purchase and construct new renewable generation and capacity, and to leverage technology to drive efficiency and customer value. And to that question you were asking about how do we judge things to customers. We were just talking about that this morning and some of the new insights we have through some of our market research capabilities. We're continuing to expand partnerships and to lead regionally. And at the same time, we're very focused on managing customer prices in the midst of inflation and volatile and rising energy costs. To do this, you can expect us to enhance programs that will help customers manage their own energy usage, including smart thermostats, peak time rebates, and as customers increasingly add solar panels, batteries to their homes and businesses, as well as, as EV's grow, we will keep our own customer, our own business expenses low through continued focus on cost management and leveraging technology and improving our processes. We're also promoting energy efficiency programs available through the Energy Trust, the Portland Clean Energy Fund. And we're going to continue to maximize liheap and Oregon heat funding, as well as expand our new income qualified bill discount program. And as we also have discussed, we're aggressively pursuing federal funds and tax credits through the IiJA IRa FEMA and working closely with the Oregon Department of Energy, as well as other state agencies, counties, tribes and others on behalf of everyone at PGE. It's a privilege to be able to provide you with electric service, to be able to update you today. We look forward to powering so many Oregonians and their businesses in the decades to come. And Larry, Brett, Kristen and I couldn't be more proud of what all of our employees are doing every day. So thank you so much for your time and your great questions. All right. Thanks to you and the team assembled here. We'll see, Lisa, some of you, as our proceedings go along here. And thanks to, as you said, all the employees at PGE that have weathered some pretty challenging circumstances in terms of the weather over the last few years. We appreciate their boots on the ground every day. Thank you. Any closing comments from my colleagues? Thank you very much. Good to see you. Thank you. Okay're adjourned. Thank you.",

        "text": "Good afternoon. Today's May 2, 2023 and we're here for a special public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. All commissioners are present and we're here for our first event in LC 80, which is Portland General Electric Company's 2023 Clean Energy Plan and Integrated Resource plan. This is also really our first public event with any content around a utility clean energy plan, so that's a milestone in itself. I want to point out as we get started here that today's meeting, as usual in our IRP process, is an information only briefing from the company to give the commissioners and anyone else who may be relatively new to the plan sor of an overall grounding in the plan. There won't be an opportunity for public comment today, but having just reviewed the schedule myself, I can tell you that the review process is lengthy and there will be extensive opportunities for public comment along the way, including a quickly upcoming opportunity for initial staff and stakeholder comments. This week we will be hearing lots of dialogue about the CEP and IRP again starting this week and extending all the way through the calendar year, and we're really looking forward to that engagement with the company and the parties. We'll start today by getting from Portland general and overview of the plan and the process that led to it'm not sure who's starting for PGE, but I know you have a slide deck, so Christriy, why don't me go ahead and pull that up? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Chaird Decker, commissioners Tani and Thompson. I'm here on behalf of PGE. I'm joined by my. I'm the director of resource planning and sustainability and I'm joined here by my colleague Seth Wiggins, who's our IRP manager, Sean Foster, who is here to answer any questions as may relate to some of the transmission issues that were raised in this year's filing, and our attorney, Erin Aberson, and your permission, they'll jump in to respond to questions as we see fit. In terms of what kinds of issues you'd like us to dive into, we've prepared some slides just to sort of jumpstart our conversation today, I think. First, I just want to say on behalf of PGE, really want to thank you for this opportunity to present our combined filing of the Clean energy plan and Integrated resource plan. As you all know, you know, in any given sort of IRP cycle, the process of producing an IRP is a very intensive task for the utility. And this year the complexity evolved very significantly as we had to include the emissions targets established by HP 2021 and the guidelines for the clean energy plan that were established by the commission. But it was a process that PG found extremely rewarding, not only in terms of helping to drive greater clarity and alignment internally around how we will meet the state's AMB ambitious emissions targets, while continuing to serve our customers reliably and affordably, but also in terms of the conversations that it encouraged the utility have with stakeholders and broader community around decarbonization and what those pathways and opportunities and challenges look like, and how particular communities can benefit and participate in that decarbonization journey. So just want to recognize that we're grateful for this process and grateful for this opportunity to enter into this next stage with all of you and in continued engagement with our stakeholders as we continue to receive a lot of very thoughtful feedback on our filing. Let's go ahead to the next slide, if we could. So just very, very briefly, just want to ground folks in where PGE was in terms of carbon emissions and ourour ##ce mix at the beginning of this process. So I think everyone's aware we already report annually on our greenhouse gas emissions from power associated with our Oregon retail customers. We do that on an annual basis to DEQ. In 2022, the last year for which we have data, you know, fully available, our emissions were at about 6.06 million metric tons, and happy to report that that's already a 25% decline from the HP 221 target baseline levels. Of course, we've got a long way to go still. You know, we're required to get to an 80% reduction below our baseline by 2030 and 90% by 2035 and 100% reduction below baseline by 2040. In terms of our resource mix, what that looks like going into this process, 39% of the power that is specified serving retail customers comes from non emitting resources, primarily hydro, wind and solar. 34% of the mix in 2022 still came from gas, 6% from coal and that 21% other unspecified primarily reflects imports into our system to serve our customers that come in into unspecified capacity, either because of the unspecified nature of the contracts, short term market transactions that we engage in, or in some cases those may reflect imports through the energy imbalance market operated by the California ISO. Let's go ahead and jump to the next slide again just to get",

        "text": " and cause them to have very difficult choices to make in terms of being able to sell power, even on an as available basis. Okay, thanks. I think we need to move on now. Appreciate you bringing that issue to our attention. I think my last one that I had on my previously notified list here is Tyler for Nu Sun Energy. So go ahead. Good morning, chair Decker and Commissioner Tani actually going to defer to mister Stepieven on behalf of NAn. Okay, perfect. Good morning. Morning. She Decker. Commissioner Tani. Yeah. For the record, Jake Stevens for n Sun energy. And I have a number of comments here, including practical examples, statutory standards, you know the mechanics. And I think you addressing a number of the questions that Commissioner Tani and you, chair Decker, brought up along the way. I just want to start by noting, you know, the statutory standard here under purpose, state and federal, is to encourage qfs and to treat them in a nond discriminatory manner. And so our objectives and the treatment of this should keep that in mind. I would also note relative to that, that while there's I think, a lot of thoughtfulness in the staff report, and I think Ted jumped back into this midstream here after being kind enough to rejoin the commission staff. You know, some of the issues that we have raised that are substantive have been omitted from the staff report, and so they're not fully addressed here. And a chief among those is that a QF has a right to sell as available power as generated, and this interconnection policy should not be preventing or terminating that, or conditioning the ability of a QF to sell power on a short term, real time basis based on the obligation to sign an interconnected agreement. And so, and you're welcome to clarify otherwise if it was your intention that qfs not have the right to sell their output and be interconnected to the grid. But I felt like the intention of your prior order was to the extent you want a long term contract, it's going to be necessarily, most likely non standard PPA. I do think that standard ppas could probably have some language that actually accommodate this, but I think you recognize that there's a lot of unforeseen issues that needed to be sorted out, and so it probably would be a non standard PPA if you wereing your right, not obligation to sell under a Leo a long term power contract. So given the federal rights to sell real time as available at such prices specified as the avoided cost cond, the commission should not be preventing or conditioning the right to interconnect to the grid and sell power on executing a long term agreement. In addition to that, that counterparty is generally, as it has been demonstrated, I think, across a number of dockets, relatively hostile and acrimonious, and certainly doesn't see eye to eye on a number of issues. So if we have, you know, 100 issues in a standard PPA DoC docket that takes six months or four years to sort out, I don't think assuming that you're going to sort it out in 120 days or whatever time is appropriate. I do think that perhaps requiring the utilities to provide reasonable proposals within fixed timef FRme in order to open up those conversations is appropriate. We do recognize that they have some challenges. I would also note that they've effectively asserted that they can't even provide curtailment proposals and essentially asserting, you know, an unwillingness or inability to provide curtailment studies, modeling, etcetera. So requiring that they and we reach a solution in a timerame that people are both on both sides asserting as functionally impossible is also problematic. But ultimately, the requirement for mutual agreement here from the buyer is a right to kill the project and a right to kill, kill the entire investment. And so that is discouraging to the investment environment, the stability of the framework. And ultimately, it is a right to kill your project and your investment. And that's an issue at the beginning of the investment. It's an issue throughout the negotiation and that fatal consequence, which is ultimately their unilateral discretion to not sign. And I would like to use that as to kind of transition into the other discriminatory aspects of this, a QF and a PPA. Can I stop you for a second and just ask you, by Sor bringing up the ways in which the QF may use its legal leverage around the must purchase obligations of purpa, I don't think you're helping your cause. We are trying to implement a policy that allows for some experimentation without getting rate pairs stuck into a situation where there are significant network upgrades that are not worth it and are not compensated by the interconnecting project. What your comments are making me feel is that there's really no way to avoid that. I'm just cautioning you that helping us solve that problem is what's going to be more effective. It is possible that",

        "text": " it way at all. Save that for later. But know, no, I think what's taken the wrong way, that I don't care about what happens between 80% and 100%, but it is true that I care most about getting to 80% right now. So that's why my question relates to that. Yeah, fair enough. Thank you. I'll just hit it at a high level. I think it's useful. And also I don't want to forget if I get five slides into it to address this later. So I do think it's very achievable. In fact, a good chunk of that green bar, I would say has already been contracted. So when we say it includes, and again, this is all just through 2030. So we're really talking about resources in the IRP update preferred portfolio and Oregon share of that, you know, from 2024 through 2029 or so. Right. And included in that mix, you know, we've got 194 mw that already assigned to come online this year. And these are numbers when I say this year, by summer of this year, Cedar Creek and Foot Creek repowering and that's in our portfolio and that would be reflected ##use they're not existing resources. There're still future resources in that green bar. So those are coming online. We've got 300, you know, signed contracts coming out of the last RFP coming online by you this year. But summer of next year, 2025 cor shadow solar facility that also, we've added 400 battery to that through an amendment to that contract to add additional capacity to the system. And these are things already executed that are under construction or plan to come online. And then we have all of the projects that came out of the last RFP, two associated with wind. So over 1300 wind in Wyoming sign under construction coming online the end of this year into 2025. Trying to think of some other items I may be missing. Soess I guess maybe what I'm really asking is what you're describing part of the gray bar or the green bar? Those are part of the green bar in the sense that they are not existing facilities. Right. They're not turning wind turbine, but they may have been selections from rps and possibly even rfps prior to the 2023 IRP update selection. You're not. The green bar does not only represent incremental. Yes, there's resources there. Future IRP update. Yeah, it's really future resources. We're not delineating by when, when they were signed or where do they come from. They're still not operating. They're not on the system right now, they will be. So a large chunk of that is very likely. There's some that's not. And then maybe to close out my point, by the time we get to 2030, and I'll say now we anticipate another round of procurement coming out of the 25 IRP process in addition, and that would still be time to procure the things that even our IRP update says to be coming online and kind of that 2827 272-028-2029 timeframe to hit these targets. So I think we're on a path to get to that green bar and it's the yellow bar that is not identified in is clean resource procurement that's not identified in the 2023 RP update. That would have to be sort of incremental, potentially state specific. O thank you. Yes. And still focus on the practicality of that still focused on a pool of resources that are real projects active in our interconnection process. Right. So it's not even, you know, just a fake IRP type, you know, project that, you know, we tend to model in the out years that come in. Okay, thanks. Yep. All right. I knew we were going to sit on that slide for a bit, so thank you for hanging in there with me. And if we can move to the next slide. Oh, yes, Rick, thanks for this. The chair of questions, I think are really helpful. And I wonder in table 6.3 and the IRP update is a little bit confusing, although I appreciate the effort to explain what's changed between the IRP and the IRP update. And I just wonder if you can help me see in the, in table 6.3 on page 91. So when I see in the 2025 column 1300 megawatts of wind. That's what you're talking about. Those are the signed contracts that you were just talking to the chair about? Yeah, ive not gotten there yet, but. Yes, and then. Yes, exactly. But then when I look further, when I look at the differential, the differential table below let you get there, you see a bunch of numbers in parens. Those are procurements that were described in the IRP. What are now not going to happen in the IRP update. I'll",

        "text": " of us today, I see some similar kind of dynamics at play. So, for example, the commercial operation date, there's parties that think, you know, you're going too fast. You're demanding projects that are, you know, ready to come online very quickly, and you should strike a balance different than that and, you know, open up the timeframe a little bit here. Transmission rights, you know, PGE is saying, well, we'll go with conditional firm, you know, that has set number of hours, but we don't want to expose ourselves to the kind of uncertainty that comes with the systems conditions. Conditional firm on the interconnection, you know, you're kind of making a call to say, let's get the projects that have really made it quite far through the interconnection process, instead of ones that are a little bit more early, early on. And so you. I think about the interests that are served there. And I think on all of those topics, I see PGE kind of prioritizing pretty strongly. We want projects that are pretty far along, that are pretty well baked, that seem like they can get through all of these processes quickly. So you're really prioritizing certainty and operation of these projects. And you seem to be steering, you know, very far away from taking speculation about projects that you may or may not turn out to really pencil. And so, you know, the one thing that that undermines, I guess, would potentially be the overall price of energy. If we wanted to just make sure that we got the lowest price project for customers, we would generally want to cast a really wide net and say, who's out there? Tell us your timef frme what can you bring to the table? And so that, in my mind, is an important trade off that's being made here. And I just want to test kind of why you're feeling that way. And if I were to guess, I'm feeling a little bit. First off, PGA has identified that there may be a capacity shortfall in 2026. And that clearly drives me for certainty and quick, quick projects. But even if that doesn't be, you know, get proofed out through the IRP process, I still see you kind of saying we want to grab some projects that are ready to go. So when I try to just, you know, this is just from my mind and I just wanted to test it with you. You know, some of the thinking might be that, you know, the transmission system is getting more and more constrained, interconnection processes are getting pretty lengthy and difficult for developers to navigate. And the concern may be that if you cast a really wide net and ask in this RFP what all projects are out there over the next four or five or six years that you may end up selecting based on price, some projects that ultimately turn out to not really be well situated to navigate, thrill at uncertainty, and they may go away and you may miss out on the more likely projects that can really be operationalized. And so it feels like you're saying, given all this uncertainty and given the fact that PGE needs to acquire resources that are renewable, and we know that, let's take this RFP and really focus on getting access to the projects that are quite certain to go, that are far along in the process. But again, some of that's just in my mind trying to tie together a, put a theme over the top of all of these issues. And I just kind of wanted to test that with you. And how would you supplement that or take exception to those thoughts? Yeah, Commissioner Thompson, I think you're right on with that. I think that we are seeing ourselves in a little bit of an inflection point here. Here we have a CEP IRP that is noting the potential for a very near term capacity need and then also noting the possibility of annual energy need as we pursue continual progress toward House Bill 2020, one's decarbonization goals. I think overlaid with that, one of the key discussions that we had in the I roundtable process last fall was this concept that Bonneville Power administration's transmission system is becoming increasingly constrained. And I think that one of the things we pointed out was the transmission service requests that had been requested in 2022 and prior that were pointed toward PGE and that we're able to meet long term firm and conditional firm service. We'only around 1800. Our hope is that as we move this RFP forward and we look to acquire that remaining inventory of high value transmission, we're seeking that appropriate balance for customers of identifying high value projects with the remaining inventory of high value transmission that are able to deliver to us near term. And I think we understand and we recognize that that need to cast a wide net is certainly there. And it's certainly something that we'll have to be a growing part of the acquisition process as we think about the decade",

        "text": " is attempting to kind of have that interim solution while we see how either a regional transmission organization or some other format that we are, I think all looking at as coming down the road, how that's going to affect a lot of the issues raised in this. And also want to recognize the fact that a lot of the issues raised are issues that we're seeing in other places. And we'll be discussing, continuing to discuss so complicated issue with a lot of ramifications and a lot of direction. But I really appreciate this staff's ability to incorporate stakeholder comments and try to thread the needle and come up with a solution that is the best that we can get to at this moment time. Okay, thanks. You know, I don't have a ton to add, although I do want to kind of move us a little bit with my remarks into the kind of big issue that's presented to us. And, and I think that the biggest thing I see reflecting on the changing market conditions that Commissionshani talked about is that this program and the regional program that it's modeled on and tracking to the western resource adequacy program, they have to show up as an end state, and the participants or entities that are required to conform to them, as the case may be, are in a complicated transition to getting to that end state. And I think that this last round of comments has really, and outside regional dialogue around the resource adequacy program, too, have showed us that there's a lot of very real challenges that aren't about ess'kind, of not wanting to make a transition to take on more reliability, expectations, and to play differently in a transmission market that looks really different. But they are just like, frankly, the utilities are in another way kind of struggling to navigate toward that in the conditions of scarcity that we find. But the question for me is do we change what is the right end state because of the struggles in that transition, or do we find a way to do what commissioner Taney characterized as setting boundaries and incentives that keep us moving on that path to what we think the right end state is? And so I think both the state program and you as it is and the regional program are going to be doing some navigating in the next few years, and I'm not inclined to change the end state. I really do hear that it might not be possible to achieve certain things like 75% transmission, deliverability, whatever, and it's going to be difficult sor of for our staff to have the expertise, if I'm being honest, to understand where that could, where more could have been done to try to meet that. And we'renna have to navigate that. But I'm not inclined to sort of take the pressure out of that transition for I'm not inclined to sort of take all the pressure out, out of the framework so that, you know, some participants in a competitive system are having to do the hard thing right now, which is to get that clean capacity and others aren't right. That doesn't strike me as what retail competition is supposed to be about. And so I guess that's a way of leading us toward the first and sort of biggest issue here, which is whether we're inclined to direct work on the really, honestly pretty constructive suggestions that ess have made around capacity, backstop charge and requests for offers. I just really understand and don't dispute the reasons that have led them to make those suggestions. And I want to point out that as we work through our list of issues, the very last issue on our sort of chronological list has to do with how the commission wants to approach setting out consequences for not performing in this program. And I prefer to recognize the transition by addressing that, then by fundamentally changing the point of responsibility for the procurement. We can get more specific on that. But I guess I just wanted to say in my opening remarks that situation I see out there in the world, although it's real, doesn't incline me to the particular solutions that have been offered right now. I want to say one more thing about why, before I stop talking, which is that, you know, as Commissioner Tawi pointed out, there are some things that our staff needs to be able to lean into and that we need to be able to lean into to help actually find those solutions to the reliability challenges to try to promote good thinking about transmission, expansion, efficient utilization, procurement in new areas. Right. One of my concerns with the proposed solution is that it's difficult. Right? Like those are big new, those would be big new things for our staff to try to figure out either administrative charges for or processes that respect material sensitive market information in the case of requests for offers. And I don't want to. I don't think that's pointing them in the direction of solving the problem that everyone is experiencing in the best way. So I will just let one of you pick up the thread on whether you are inclined to direct staff to work up an alternative to the transmission forward showing requirement. And you've heard",

        "text": "ized anyway. What do we do? How do we reconcile that factual premise with the question of whether PGE's plan or any clean energy plan has taken into account economic and technical feasibility? Well, I think that we. My mind goes back to the carbon planning bill that we had proposed in 2009 that would have had us look very much at these very questions as to whether they're technologically or economically feasible and put them into our IRP. You know, that is, we have technologies that we know are on the cusp. We have technologies that we know are already in the pipeline. I think that it's incumbent upon us to, you know, for purposes, and this is moving into IRP planning, and perhaps, you know, not my strong suit, but we bake in, at least in our IRP, the things that are actually available today, we can't specifically rely on the ones that aren't. But moving into the CRP, the CEP, it may be logical to consider those that are you know, on the edge and give them some amount of assessment as in terms of whether they could come into play. You know, that's going to obviously skew the economics a little bit. But it is not an unreasonable thing to ask. I don't, yeah, I'm not really asking you to be an IRP expert here, I guess I'm just saying, I'm just asking if one of the public interest considerations that the commission is to apply is whether the plan achieves economic and technical feasibility. Global answer may be no. What is the legal foundation at this moment? What is the sort of legal foundation for how we balance, look at, don't look at that public interest factor. Well I think that that probably tails in directly to the existing IRP processes and guidelines for assessing whether technologies are available to help meet load's. You know, that's what we've been doing, that's what we'll continue to do. And to me when I look at 469 8420, sub two, paragraph b, that's exactly what re, what we're required to do. We can't include things that aren't available yet, you know, specifically we can look at them, we can assess whether they're going to become available, we can provide market analysis, but in terms of relying on it, we have to rely on what's there. And I think that, you know, your assessment then pursuant to the law, in terms of whether it's in the public interest or not, you know, unless there is evidence that, that we've left something out that is available that we should be putting in, then we've done our jobk. Thank you. I think that's. And yes, thank you Mister McCarthy. That is your time. That's my time. Okay. And we'll now go to Oregon cub for five minutes. Mister Getz. Great, thanks your honor on this one. Yeah, I'll also be pretty brief here and answer any questions the commission might have. I think the question framed in the scoping order here was before applying the public interest criterion, which to me at least means should the commission opine in this proceeding on what they mean before you rule on the ceps themselves. Because those orders, at least in the way that I think about it, will include a discussion of whether or not you think the utilities have met the different criterion here. And so it's still cubs position that no, you don't need to do that in this proceeding because it'll happen organically over the course of acknowledging or not acknowledging ceps that move forward. And you should retain the discretion to do that on a fact by fact and case by case basis on the economic and technical feasibility, I'll give you something to consider that maybe you can take into account when you're looking at ceps. I do think on the economic side you should consider the impacts on customers of the glide path towards 100% emissions free compliance and making sure that we're not backloading that compliance. I think some of this will get into the continual progress piece that I'll talk about a little bit later. But we want to make sure that we're not in a situation where we need to roll off a bunch of thermal resources, potentially pay for accelerated depreciation and throw a bunch of new non emitting resources on all at the same time. And so rate shock should be a consideration and then also technical operation. We shouldn't be relying on resources that have not achieved sufficient market penetration. I'm like, oh, we're go goingna get this molten salt battery in the future that nobody even has yet, but it's go goingna make us get to our 100% clean goals. I'm using that is of course an illustrative example. But those are the types of things that I think you should be thinking about when you're applying this economic and technical feasibility criterion. Thank you. I just have one brief question. I understand the point in your briefing that think the commission should retain the flexibility that the law gives here and that the commission has in the public interest standard tot",

        "text": ", just for our edification, would you mind explaining what. What would need to be done to collect minimum load information? That's, you know, kind of like the worst case scenario. I'm assuming that you have a feeder where you're able to collect maximum load information. Is it just a matter of data tracking or is there actually equipment reconfiguration that somehow needs to be done? I think like say that different utilities have different capabilities and everybody's looking to capture this data. I mean, I think there's an understanding that capturing this data is best practice. It's just some places are more behind because they're more rulural and they have more feeders that haven't had need for upgrades for a while. So it's just a longer term practice. I think everybody's moving this way to get more visibility ono what's happening on their circuits. So I don't think it's problematic necessarily how you're defining minimum load. You know, like use the circuit section if you have that data. If not use the. Use the overall theeder data. And if you don't have that, use the 15%. I think at least to some degree everybody's tracking towards getting that for the circuit data. It's what you do with that data. If you set 90% as the rule, if it's a mandatory approval and you're on a place where you have 80% penetration and three vo voltage or I'm getting way out over my ski tips. But whatever that concern is about 80% on the substation transformer then and mandatory approval is problematic. So. So I don't know. I hope I answered your question there. Clarified more that we think how written the penetration screen is great. It's just there are those circuits where it's 80% is probably the right screen for the blunt tool of this penetration screen. Yeah. Thanks Eric. I was just trying to understand a little bit more of the glide path. Getting everybody on board with tracking that data basically. I wasn't sure if that was much of an equipment rollout issue or more of just a internal data tracking type of issue. Other thoughts? I'm curious but you know't, we don't need to belabor it. No, I think it is an equipment rollout issue in some areas. You know it's just, it's a bigger concern some places where the. And the standard is, you know, to start to get that data collection in place. But the different utilities have different glide paths on and different lifts for how hard that is to get there. So one year would be really problematic I bet to include that here rather than just for the individual utilities to develop their plans and have those sort of approved in the DSP process. Thanks. And Brian, I don't know this is still relevant but we had also discussed that, you know, pointing to some of the other screens that that might address the concern for the need to go below 90% to. We want to go over that here as well. Well some of that hinges on this. You know, I think. I don't think we were. I don't think we had the 80% issue pointed to us in the initial review screens and the utility comments before. So that's kind of new information that we have to review. Yeah. You know I wanted to look into the assumptions that that's based on the information in 1547.2 is based on to see what really needs to be considered there. An initial review. But we do have in terms of, you know, grounding risks, we have the line configuration screen lean back on. It's not an 80% screen. So that's. Sure the utilities would still push back upon that. But the intention is that the grounding issues are also covered by the line configuration screen. And then if that has failed, then again, supplemental review grounding screen could more granularly assess the grounding needs of that interconnection. You know, I think your question there does suggest that we should, with that specific issue in mind, does how you have the grounding screen written address our concerns with, with the. Don't know, I don't know what three vl means, but with that consideration, if we don't catch it with the penetration screen and we have a concern there, do we catch it with the grounding screen as written? I think that we should do a little bit of more of analysis on our side, um, just because trying to do it over chats is hard here. So maybe we should do some analysis as you're doing analysis on that, on that screen also and see if, see if that, if we do catch it with that other screen, even in this preliminary fast track screening process. Yeah, that sounds good. And that is based on the batteries project, which you, we worked with in conjunction with EPRI to create that screen. And they've done a lot of work on the grounding practices and whatnot. And so I'm hoping we got that honed in. But yeah, I need to chat with them and probably ray walling about",

        "text": " are out for many rfps. And so when we're saying just 1020 30 mw, that's significant. And the consequence of misstating that in the over is that we missed the mark on what we need to procure. And so it seems like with that in mind, the scenario is an excellent opportunity without creating any negative consequences. So I'm not sure if that fully answered your question, but that's why and where we differ from staff and stakeholders, I think that's helpful. I think you're just saying 60 MW is meaningful to us right now and we are different not just in theory in the future when we get to hundreds of megawatts of renewals, but we're different today because renewal landscape is dramatically different for the vast majority of the QFS given the Idaho regulatory structure.

Or if you're calling in by phone, please press star nine to raise your hand. Okay, excellent, Jennifer, then Katie and then Ireian. Good afternoon. Genennifer good afternoon, chair Decker, Commissioner Tani, Commission Perkins, thank you for your time today. Don't really have any additional public comments to make in addition to what we've filed in this docket. But I do want to make myself available to answer any questions if the commissioners have any, any questions for Jennifer Cubs comments not hearing any right now.

All right, let's go to Katie Chamberler for renewable our request. Good afternoon, chair Decker, Commissioner Taney and Commissioner Perkins. My name is Katie Chamberlain and I work for Renewable Northwest. We'd like to just briefly support voice or support for staff's three overarching recommendations to acknowledge the IRP, to approve the expectations for the 2025 IRP, and to approve the waiver request. First, Idaho powers s 2023 IRP made clear that renewable and storage resources are the foundation of a lease cost lease risk portfolio, and acknowledging Idaho Power's action items will support the company's procurement of renewable energy and its continued exploration and build out of transmission projects, among other things. Second, we support staff's recommendations for the 2025 IRP or sorry expectations for the 2025 IRP. And in particular, we would like to see Idaho power model scenario where the company exits all coal by 2030. And we would also like to see, as previously discussed, robust analysis of the cost, benefits and risks associated with installing CCS on Bridger three and four, converting them to gas or exiting the units al together. And finally, we support approving Idaho powers waiver request for the IRP update given the company's plans to file the 2025 IRP in July of 2025. Thank you and I'm available for questions. Thanks for appearing before us. Welcome. And are there any questions for Katie on renewable Northwest perspective? All right, thanks for sharing your point of view and for engaging in the bucket. Okay, let's go with Irene Sim good afternoon chair Decker, commissioners Perkins and Tawy, I speak with you again today. Re'recommendation in this case is for the commission to adopt the staff recommendations, numbers nine and ten, regarding wind QF renewal rates, just to level set. Those recommendations are that IAHO power should assume a 75% win QF renewal rate pending a nonero renewal rate determination via future methodology accepted by the commission. As a reminder, ReC originally recommended in 85% wind QF rew rate, but we're supportive of staff's recommendation and we also support the staff's recommendation that the company employ a nonero QF renewal rate in line with Pacific course estimateation methodology in the 2025 IRP. We've been litigating the various QF renewal issues one way or another for over a decade now. The commission sorry. The coalition's basic position is that the commission should use ten years of historical data if it's available to develop a Qf renewal rate. We support revising that historical data based on reasonable or justifiable assumptionsurate and accurate estimates so that ten years of historical data can be adjusted based on specific facts and circumstances. Here, one of those facts and circumstances is the expressed interest by QF owners and operators to renew their contracts over the past decade, PGE, Pacificoreps and Idaho Power have all raised a variety of different and often contradictory arguments regarding why they should each assume a zero QF renewal rate for PG and PacifiCorps. As you're aware, the commission determined in their",

        "text": " going through on the demand side, or I understood you, I guess, to be talking about the demand side, the energy efficiency side of the customer action as PGE has classified it. In PGE's action plan. They also talk about incorporating the quantities in their cost effective forecasts of distributed energy resources. Then however only really talk specifically about demand response resources, which again a component of ders. But I'm not sure where the action plan talks about customer sited generation and storage or whatever, and whether that I believe that's still treated as according to technical potential and achievable potential and then around the load forecast as a decrement to the needed procurement there rather than as an active customer actions strategy. I think I can save this question for when we talk about what we mean by a transmission alternatives analysis, but as I said earlier, there's a paradigm issue about on system resources and that include both kind community based renewable energy that we're going to talk about in a second that would come through an RFP. And then the more I don't know what the right fancy word is for this, but the customer chosen behind the meter solar storage, whatever that comes into play, I think, I think primarily in the load forecast, but again, I'm not sure. And so I find myself going like how do we talk about the expectations for that paradigm issue when there's no action item or anything thatt of pertains to it? And maybe there is and I'm missing it. So I guess I want to ask staff first if my understanding is correct that PGE's action plan just reflects taking what comes from the environment around distributed solar whatever, that doesn't qualify as sort of CBR RFP type resources, or whether and sort of how staff has analyzed PGE's role in what is available in that space and whether the technical and achievable analysis for those types of resources needs has been discussed for modernization in the same way that Commissioner Tani just talked about the energy efficiency side. I realized this is out of nowhere. But as these different pieces come together, I realized that this was a gap in my understanding. I mean, my understanding is in the customer actions. The focus is on energy efficiency and demand response, which could be connected to customer cited generation resources. But those weren't necessarily explicitly discussed or analyzed. I think I might ask PGE's team, if they're available to sort of, again, not from an advocacy perspective today, but just to explain, do I have it correct that the achievable cost, whatever, that this is treated ASRT a decrement to the load forecast and. And manage a. A reactive thing? And if so. So why doesn't it show up in the customer actions with a proactive strategy in the way that EE demand response and community based renewable energy does? The answer is. Well, the answer to the first part is yes, your understand is correct. The question of why, like where's the plan to effectuate that it's, you know, PG is not a passive, excuse me, actor right now in the de airspace. We need to actively pursue these resources. And so I think part of this goes to the avoided costs question as we have to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of these resources. That needs to be part of the conversation that we've been talking a lot about for something like, um. 1893, like this update of how we do avoided costs to reflect the transmission constraints and emission constraints that we have. That needs to be included in it as well. I don't think we've put enough. There hasn't. I think you're absolutely right. There hasn't been much discussion in this docket similar to the energy efficiency side, where a lot of attention has been paid to those methods. They're directly applicable to doctor procurement as well. And so. Yeah, I can stop there. Yeaheah, I think that's fine. I appreciate the candor and just the confirmation. I appreciate you limiting it there. And I don't think I need anything else. I'm just going to say that as PGE is considering, as I read in the business journal and here around the way, proposals around that metering and promoting storage and those are going to need to be seen with an eye to where they fit in the resource planning paradigm. And I think that this kind of avoided cost concept, and there's never kind of been an avoided cost to sort of solve for every resource. Frankly, I don't think it totally works to say we're doing this in EE and therefore it will translate. But. Exactly. But the concept in an environment where, as commissioner Tanei said at the beginning, we taking, we have various wedges and we're not expecting an IRP to have a pinpoint forecast. We are expecting rfps and the equivalent thereof, which ISR that avoided cost analysis, what pricing drives uptake of customer resources where you don't have, where an RFP is not going to be the controlling factor. I I think the omission of, of a more active strategy there juxtap",

        "text": " limited incomes. I also always think of the stories and experiences that we don't get to hear in these spaces. Annual increases in rates cannot be the new norm. This cannot continue yearly with no end in sight. And there has to be another way. We have a duty to our neighbors and those in our communities to ensure that energy assistance programs actually provide relief from energy burden. That it's not difficult or burdensome to receive this assistance and that we're preparing for and adapting to climate change equitably. Once again, I urge the commission to use your authority to diligently scrutinize this request in light of the current economic climate and the way it's impacting real people. Thank you. Thank you. We'll go to Kendall, followed by Bel Burgges and Philip M. Hello, my name is Kendall and I'm severely opposed to this rate increase. The last increase more than doubled my monthly bill, and I haven't. I've used less electricity and I have less occupants in my home. That's not acceptable. My pay has not increased to that matter. It's not acceptable to have a company making billions in profit to raise the rates on income of people that aren't getting their incomes raised. And they're certainly not making the income that those corporations that are making either. I agree with the Willamette Valley workers in the proposals that they've requested. And I also agree with the other people in that the shutoffs are like, they're at a corporate level, they're not at a personal level. And it's not acceptable to raise all the rates and expect people to live while we want to say we have a homeless crisis. Well, I wonder why they can't have their basic needs met. And it's not fair. There has to be other ways to make it so that PGE can do their business without rate increasing on the people that are hurting the worst. I really hope the commission takes into consideration that, as Yamhiill county or Lafayette had mentioned, that the rate increases over the last three years are astronomical. It's not just a little 3% here, or 4%. It's a lot. And you wouldn't expect that from yourself. Like, you wouldn't just go and say, hey, I'm going to put an extra 30% into savings every month. Because, you know, I need to prepare for whatever. And that's what PGE is doing to us. While on top of making billions a year. And that's unacceptable. So I really hope the commission listens to the people and understands that it's a burden that's not one that can be helping the crisis that we have in terms of mental health, physical health, employment options and then housing. I appreciate you taking your time to listen. Thank you. We'll go to Bill Burggess, then Philip M, then Stepven. So, Bill Burggess. Okay. Do you hear me now? Great. Thank you. Bill Burgess, Marion county clerk and Salem Oren. And I got quite a few notes from other constituents telling me they could not afford the increase. And from what ive ve heard tonight, it really gives you the feeling, and im sure your commissioners understand it, that it can affect some people much more than other people. And we need to find a fairer way to make sure that the improvements that PGE is asking for can take place. But in maybe a completely different type of rate structures. We certainly want those local battery storage projects, those investments in transmission in distribution, and those upgrades in technology for increased resilience. We know all of that is important. We know its important for people to have electricity, too. And that we just have to find maybe a different way of funding this. And I guess I was surprised when I heard so many people before me tonight speaking about the pain that this is causing them. And so I just plead for you to find a different way to have the funding available to get the job done, so that we can all depend on clean electricity and renewable energy for the future. So, thank you. Thank you. We'll go to Philip M. And then next up are Stepven and Lucas. Hi, my name is Philip. I live in Washington county. For many years now, I've been part of PGE's time of use plan. This plan, along with the newly formed time of day plan, only represents about 1% of PGE's customers. Because of this, I believe that the rate changes for those plans have been getting overlooked. I can say it definitely did for the 2024 rate increases. These proposed 2025 is also definitely unreasonable. If you're unfamiliar, these plans help shift the usage of customers energy to off peak times, such as at night and weekends when the demand on the grid is less. It also helps PGE save money. In turn, they offer a discounted rate to shift your usage. But then, on the other hand, you get charged more during these on peak raigs. Now, for my residence",

        "text": " up and provide you answers that show they can get the job done and actually comply with the law. And so I think it's fair after three years, and they effectively wrote the law that passed through the committees just almost three years ago, that they be evaluated pretty critically on what they have not done, and that what they have and haven't done includes a lot of extremely discretionary actions that have failed to comprise continual progress. At the backdrop of all of this discussion and staff's analysis is they voluntarily chose to suspend their RFP. So we had a generational level of procurement to bring thousands of megawatts into procurement. Bids were submitted. You know, they have prices, they have information, they have transactable assets. They wrote the commission a letter that said, essentially, there's a bunch of other environmental laws that we think we need to comply with, and they omitted the law that Oregon has applied to them. HB 2021 wasn't in the letter from Pacificorp to the Public Utility Commission telling it was suspending as RFP. And I think that says a lot about what Pacificor thinks about the compliance obligations in the state of Oregon. And I think that's reflected in the plan and the state of what has been presented before you. And I think that that weighs on the type of judgment and approach that you should take at this point, because in addition to the practical standards that apply here, you know, as you guys have acknowledged, you have an obligation to ensure that electric company demonstrates continual progress to, you know, as soon as practical to facilitate rapid reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, right. That they have made voluntary actions that have essentially impeded and prevented their own continual progress. And I think even further in some of their arguments, they've suggested that wildfire liabilities that have been created by somehow might be some excuse for their failure to have to follow another law. And I think across this broad spectrum of things, the signals that you send, whether you choose to reject the entire IRP and clean energy plan against those backdrops is really important because there's a degree of permissiveness that you're providing an acknowledgement that is actually acceptable to say, well, we comply with this law, but not that law. In particular, you can comply with other states and federal laws at the detriment of complying with Oregon's laws. Thus our request today, and I think we generally agree with a lot of what staff has proposed but would go a step further. I see them trying to balance timeline considerations with trying to a little bit of a square peg and a round hole to shove things into an update. But by and large, when we look at the IRP, it has many of the same issues that we brought up in the PGE, IRP and CP acknowledgement discussion a few weeks ago, which I, for technicality will incorporate and reference here and for revity. But that involves effectively bogus inputs in the models in various ways and things that fail to meet the standards that are required. And I can provide a number of examples, but they include things like nuclear power plants that will never be built on the schedules that are proposed. The commission should not suggest that that's remotely acceptable to propose things that are just not feasible. As a simple technical example, we brought up the omission of 25 million mile, 500 kv lines from the cost assumptions for pump storage projects that were, were potentially going to be built and owned by, by Pacific art and their models. Major, major flaws that just shouldn't be allowed to exist. These aren't splitting hairs and the solar cost a percent more, percent less. These are massively inappropriate assumptions that we believe and ask that the commission direct, as it rejects this IRP clein energy plan, be removed from whatever follows and is filed. The company hasn't made contind progress. We also think it is appropriate for you to document that that hasn't occurred. You are explicitly, you should tell them you have not made continual progress. You've had years, you've had options to do that. You've made discretionary decisions to not make progress. This doesn't cut it. And that should be part of the record of what occurs today, because if you don't, you're effectively saying the opposite. I think it's important, and we request that the commission make that clear. I think what I would love to hear discussust and acted on is that how shall you ensure that they do make continual progress? And you know, whether that's possible here today as it may be, to direct them to resume their RFP and to direct them to take other actions that will put that back in motion, because the state has put some obligation on you to ensure that they do. And obviously there's been a multi year setback in a large scale here. The next thing I wanted to highlight in our request is that in addition to directing resumption of the RFP is that, and it appears that just the entire IRP and clean energy plan should be refiled",

        "text": " which, you know, is in quotation marks. Our interconnection handbook does. Does point out different configurations. And while we would accept that, we would also require the customer to install protection requirements. Right. A recloser, a relay, something to trip a breaker or trip the recloser. So it's more than just a pass fail screen. So that's kind of where we're headed towards just allowing that y grounded y ground connection. The y ground y. You know, we can make the argument that there's no path for the inverter to see see anything. Same thing with the white grounded delta. You know, that's the grounding bank in itself. But there's other issues that arise from that. I know PG can, can respond to that one, but, yeah, so for either, why ground y or y ground delta? If fail this screen while not saying that you can't have it, but we want to be able to call out for the correct protection requirements to allow that interconnection. So that's kind of long winded. But what we were thinking, I don't know if Gen ed or Josh or idopower has anything to add. Hearing nothing. Oh, somebody has their hand up mid hat. Would you like to go ahead. Thanks, Ted. And thanks Lee also. Yeah, I would like to respond on this. So we like the white ground. White ground. And we appreciate there is consistence on that configuration option, but the reality is that some invs can tolerate that configuration. So there is a need for alternate grounding options to be specified. Restricting the invert screen passage to only one configuration is too restrictive, maybe unnecessary, and does not correspond to best practices. To give you some practical example that the only battery system that we are aware of that can take the white ground, white ground is the Tesla batteries. So most of them want ungrounded secondary. This is also true for some central invs. In fact, if I could point you to the Illinois rule, section 466100 a six, which is the level two expedited review. It says that if you are connecting to a three phase, four wire primary, a three phase or single phasedr should use a grounded line to neutral primary connection, period. So the Illinois rule specifies the primary side, which is W ground, and does not care what the secondary side is, which allows the doctor applicants to design the secondary side however they choose to while meeting the needs on the primary side for the utility. So I just want to point that out. So this is not just about what Pacifico has on their manual. It is also in accordance with other best practices in other jurisdictions where they just list the w ground on the high side and not bother listing the secondary. Here we have taken the delivery of listing some options on the secondary as well that would allow to be passed. And if I could add mid haat, the, if we're, you know, okay, allowing overvoltage protection to be used to, you know, to maintain effective grounding, then there doesn't appear to be any reason to prohibit y ground or y ground delta. And you know, we initially had discussion about utilizing mediaium voltage sensing on that. I'm not certain why fairly certain supplemental review shouldn't be required in order to have medium voltage sensing, which is going to be. Would be required for IEEE 115 47. If you've got a way ground delta, then you're going to have to have sensing on the mediaium voltage side for the standard. So that's something, regardless of, regardless of the screen, there's going to have to be the ability to take in applications that have medium voltage sensing that would take care of it. In this case of the y ground y and y ground delta, I'm still not clear on whether it's needed for the y ground y, but at least for the y ground delta, you will have medium voltage sensing if you're following IEEE 115 47. So that gives you the overvoltage protection that you also get in the Y ground case. So it doesn't seem like. And you might also have relays and protective elements that are separate from an inverter for other reasons as well. And you don't just send those to supplemental review or for having those elements. Right. So I'm not clear on why that would be required for this case. Yeah, this is a geneaneette Sedrk Pge. I think the problem is that this is a screen that is somewhat of a high level screen where you are not going to be able to see that they have protection for that overoltage condition on the white ground delta. And until you get in the supplemental, you're not going to get the deep dive with an engineer to look at that. And we have had problems with the YG Delta providing ground current, causing sympathic trips of our devices on our system for upstream faults. So without looking at it a lot harder than this screen",

        "text": " going to adapt to things like the storms that people have been talking about that we suffered through in January. And that task force, I just wanted to speak to that because to me, that's been the most in depth conversation that I've known of that is addressing all these issues and we analyze many, many different types of policies that could be brought forward. Members of the gas industry were there, home buildilders were there. And during that entire conversation, there was a lot of discussion about the future of gas and that whether or not the gas system could actually be decarbonized over the long haul and therefore be something that we could depend on after the transition period that people have been mentioning. The math never really seemed to pencil out that there was enough resource actually to reclaim in Oregon to meet the future need that was being proposed. Therefore, I'll just say, you know, what I came away with after all those discussions was we can really only decarbonize one of our grids, and that would be the electric grid, and that whatever amount of decarbonized gas is still available, once that is fully decarbonized, that that's probably just going to be used by industry. It's going to be way too expensive, from the economic analysis we saw, to actually be a part of the system that's feeding buildings. So I'm here to recommend that the line extension allowance modification that northwest national is asking for be rejected. And also the higher rate of return, as was mentioned by earlier testimony, does seem out of place at the moment, given that we are trying to reduce the cost of housing and the expenses related to housing today. So the only other thing, my maybe 10 seconds I have left to point out, um, is that change is hard. And we're in, we're in a state where there's a lot of change. Not the state of Oregon, the state of the world, like, where there is a lot of change that's going on. I do not underestimate that the change is hard for everybody involved, including for folks that are learning how to build buildings differently. We've heard from some folks who want to stay. We've heard some folks who say that homeowners still want to keep having the same things they've always had. But it's hard for everybody involved, and I do think everybody has to lean into it, because if we're going to get one of these systems decarbonized, it's going to take everybody putting everything they have into it. Thank you very much for your time. I appreciate it. Okay, thank you. All right. And we have another Christy Collins. I'asked you to unmute. Hopefully you saw the message. If so, go ahead and unmute. O I'm seeing the unmute, but I'm not part of the Christristy Collins thing. So unfortunately, your display name is Kristy Collins. Issue with one of the links. So if you could go ahead and just state and spell your name for the record, then you can provide your comment. Great, thanks. So my name is Josh Salinger. So, Joshsalinger, and I'm a builder in Portland, Oregon. Birdsmouth design build is our company, been in business about 15 years and chairier Decker, Judge Spruce commissioners toy Perkins. I'd just like to take this. I'm testifying today to request that the commission reject the utilities efforts to use rate pay dollars in support of their investments in false solutions like renewable natural gas and green hydrogen and mitigate the risks to rateairs from continued expansion of the gas system. I heard a bunch of things about resiliency and I kind of wanted to speak to that, just listening to some of the comments. The last house we built had solar and storage on it, and the January ice storm knocked out power and those clients didn't even notice that their power went out. In fact, they stayed completely comfortable and had access to all of their energy. We did that through electrification of the home and reducing the energy consumption of the home through a really good enclosure. And we've been doing this for 15 years. We haven't installed gas in our homes for 15 years. Our company has been very successful for can provide very healthy indoor air quality for our clients. And I argue that once you make the change to building like this, it just becomes building and it becomes the norm and it's really not any more expensive. In fact, we enjoy not having to pay to have the gas line brought into our projects. So back to the resiliency thing. It worked great in the ice storm, but I'd like to point out that there's also summer and we had a heat dome a few years back. It was 116 degrees here in Portland, Oregon. These natural gas can't keep you cool, whereas heat pumps can. Electrification is actually much more resilient than natural gas because we're missing half the equation.

        "text": ", we interpret that as nameplate capacity, not export capacity. So I'm not sure. Is there a reason to have a definition of export capacity if we're going to use nameplayate capacity, um, as the appropriate measurement? I think the concern might be when you have generation and storage at the same location. I'm not suggesting that in my head I have it really clear, but I think the concern is what is the limit of a system that can be evaluated under tier one when it has both generators and storage? If it's generating capacity, then it's. The limit is the, you know, the photovoltaic system or whatever. And that's relatively clear. But without having directly reviewed this issue, I just want to make sure that we're crystal clear, like what's allowed with the amount of storage plus the amount of generating capacity and what can be reviewed in under tier one. Yeah, well, I would think so. The battery doesn't generate. Right, so the nameplate. Well, I think if we were to interpret it generating capacity as name like capacity, which I think we've always done and measure at the inverters, that would work. Right. But I guess even in any event, if you were just to measure the primary motive force, as you were kind of saying, eric, it s what can generate. You could still have a battery of any size. You wouldn't be able to generate any more than what the facility can generate. Right, sorry, I want to. Yeah, I mean, yes, you can't generate more than the name platate capacity of the generators. Depending on the size of the inverters, you could potentially export more than the nameplate of the generators. Y. That's why you have thera capacity too. Yeah, that's a good point. But overall, I think what we ran into when we actually started to make the same updates to the division 39 as we were, you know, making to division 82, is that on the, you know, we would potentially be changing the size caps on that metering. And so we just wanted to flag that for folks mostly as like in moving to export capacity, which we all understand the benefits of, and the drivers from state policy and all of that, to be really looking towards systems with storage and such. We just want to, you know, we ran into this issue of if we did that, we would be, in effect, I think, changing the size caps we've been using on projects. And that's not necessarily in scope for this rulemaking. And so we just want to have that conversation. And Stephanie, you might be like kicking me out of the table, so maybe I screwed up, but yeah, it's just a challenge that we identified in this round that we wanted to get some feedback on. Got it. I guess that was a. Yeah, well, I was approaching it o we re. It's in the statue. We're not going to. That isn't in the scope. Sorry, but I. Yeah, I don't have anything that. Well, I think that adds clarity that the use of this is not for. Maybe I'm wondering if. I'm thinking of it the same way that the use of this nameplate capacity is for what qualifies for residential. And then using the. Using the 25 kw generating capacity is great. And it doesn't speak to if they put storage in there and then, and that leaves free the decision of what is reviewed as a tier one project. So there's like sort of separate limits within the rule. The limit within what's reviewed under tier one is 25 kw export capacity, potentially. But what's eligible for net metering residential customers to put on their house is 25 kw worth of generating capacity. And so maybe. Was looking at it wrong. No, I don't think. Well, I guess I wasn't looking at it that way. It seems to me if the limit is 25 kilowatt, you know, the underlying intention behind that would be that the experort capacity would be consistent with a 25 kilowatt facility. But that doesn't take that now. Poly Caroline'kicking me. Well, we want to. No, no, I think you're right, Stephanie, that that was probably the intent. I mean, oh my gosh. We're talking about the intense happened a long time ago. But like, the intent was probably based on the assumption that if it's 25 kw, that's its export capacity back in the day. But our. What we wanted to flag for folks, like you said, is, you know, we didn't really plan to get into the overall eligibility size caps for net metering. I think everyone knows where that conversation could go and explode. And so we chose not to make changes in what we're putting out to folks, but we also want to have this discussion. Does that sound right? Yeah, that sounds right. Or at least tee it up for folks",

        "text": " alignment with the clean energy plan objectives as well as the company's own decarbonization goals. Oregon may choose to participate in these system wide resource selections. One note on this figure, which dovetails with the next slide, is that the coal resource removal from the system shown at the bottom of this graph represents the retirement or exit of the original unit, whether converted to gas or not. And so if this graph were to show when the unit ceases to burn coal, there'd be a large acceleration of coal removal starting in 2024 and congruent with the gas conversions shown in purple in the graph. I'd also like to note that there are current IRP activities featuring Oregon interest, which include promoting electrification in the west through grants, rebates and partnerships, development and design for a project in Oregon to install battery storage at the Oregon Institute of Technology and Klamath Falls. This is a project that aligns with Oregon House Bill 2193 and helping to interconnect 64 solar resources through the Oregon Community solar program. Next slide please. On slide 17 you can see a listing of the coal exits, retirements and gas conversions, and these are all noted in the executive summary from the published IRP. In the near term, we have Jim Bridger units one and two converting to natural gas in 2024. We have Craig unit one retiring 2025 coal strp unit three exiting 2025 and the conversion of not units one and two natural gas in 2036 and operating through 2036. By 2032, all coal units are retired or converted to natural gas. Excuse me, nearly all coal units are retired and converted to natural gas by 2032. And even where coal units are retained, there's a clear trajectory of greatly reduced emitting generation where modeling outcomes indicate a new operating strategy. And we've seen this outcome in the past couple of IRP cycles and is strengthened here in the 2023 IRP. In this future, thermal units provide an economic option to filling in the gaps in renewables generation spanning short periods where renewables and storage may be unavailable. And also in the 2030 to 2032 range of years, new non emitting technologies are anticipated to come online to further support of decarbonization. Next slide please. In this graph showing accumulated coal exits, retirements and gas conversions, I'll note that the yellow triangles in the graph are there to denote points of significant change in the trajectory of the data. This may be helpful in the reading of the filed IRP documents. If you review the executive summary, there's many more graphs like this with those same yellow triangles. And there's a pretty clear trend and a change of trajectory from the 2021 IRP. You can see that this trajectory of exiting cod generation, for example, has accelerated compared to the 2021 RP. And by 2033, virtually all of the coal fleet has exited retired or converted gas. Can I ask you a brief question on this? Yes, slide. I feel like I got thrown with the footnote to says that yellow triangles highight points of significant change in nuclear resources. Sorry, that is a mistake. That sounds like a copy paste error and I'll definitely take a look at that. Ye but I get it now. Thank you so much. I had a similar confusion and I in the listing from the prior page, you referenced several instances where SNCR is being installed. That is a selective catalytic scrubber or a small nuclear reactor. Oh, that's the selective non catalytic reduction. It's not nuclear. Okay. Because then this footnote said nuclear. And so then I y apologies for that. Decide whatn stood for. Yeah. So if we go back one slide, how do I understand youre re saying everything'retired? Nearly everything is retired by 2032 or converted to gas. But Hunter and Huntington are help me understand whats happening to them there in 2031 and 2032. Okay, so maybe one thing that would be helpful is to note that this is listing off the retirement years and also shows the installation year for the SNCR so that you can see both when the SC SNCR is installed and then when the unit subsequently retires. So for Hunter units one, two, and three, we have retirements happening in the 2031 and 2032 range. And then for Huntington units one and two, we have retirements happening in the 2032 range. For all of those units, we have SNCR, pardon me, being installed in 2026. So the IRP proposes to put catalytic scrubbers, to put scrubbers, not small nuclearrect, put scrubbers in these five units and then retire the units in five years. That's exactly right. And I can see where at first that would seem to be an unlikely thing to do. But keep in mind that the SNCR, as opposed to the SCR",

        "text": " to have the gas line brought into our projects. So back to the resiliency thing. It worked great in the ice storm, but I'd like to point out that there's also summer and we had a heat dome a few years back. It was 116 degrees here in Portland, Oregon. These natural gas can't keep you cool, whereas heat pumps can. Electrification is actually much more resilient than natural gas because we're missing half the equation. If you have an elderly parent or an older person or someone that is on the front line, communities that can't handle that heat in their homes, this is a way to make these buildings survivable. So with the introduction of renewables and storage, we can actually reduce the electrical usage through energy conservation, building enclosures, and we can make homes healthier and much more resilient. So anyways, wanted to point that out and thank you for the opportunity to comment. Thank you. And then the last person I see in the queue appears as Oregon PSR O. So I'm going to hit allow to talk and then there you go. If you could go ahead and state and spell your name for the record, and then you may provide your comment. Yes. Good afternoon, commission. Or, I guess, good night. My name is Samantha Hernandez Samanthahernandez, and I am the healthy climate program director at Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility. We are an organization of over 2000 health professionals and public health advocates working to address the greatavest threats to health and survival. And we are here today urging the commission to reject Northwest Natural's general rate revision. Last month was Earth's warmest march on record, making it the 10th month in a row to set a global heat record. We are living in unprecedented times of financial hardship due to record high inflation and the economic consequences of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Approving this rate case increase would impact energy burden households the most. Higher rates means families will have less money to purchase goods required for health, such as adequate shelter, healthy food and medical care. Now is not the time to be expanding gas subsidies that will hurt people's pockets and their health. Northwest Natural is proposing to increase the subsidy to up to $3,600 per hookup, which could cost customers tens of millions per year, and this is not affordable at all. Moreover, gas appliances generate a number of harmful air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and formaldehyde, both indoors and outdoors, that have been linked to a variety of serious health harms. Burning hydrogen gas in buildings, a false solution northwest natural is relying on, also creates air pollution that contributes to asthma, heart disease and premature deaths. Natural gas is not a reliable source of energy, as others have claimed. In extreme cold casp pipelines and power plants are failing to deliver when they're most needed. There's a common myth that gas appliances are better because they keep working when the lights go out. While natural gas can still flow into a home during a blackout, many appliances still require power to operate. And moreover, several studies have shown that all of that trick new homes save costs both upfront and over time. Mixed fuel homes, for example, in both Seattle and Spokane, cost more than $7,200 more to build than all electric homes. Oregon PSR strongly urges the commission to reject Northwest natural's rate increase and thank you so much for the opportunity to testify. Thank you. Okay, so I see we have two more folks who joined the que. This is going to be the last two, and I'm sorry for anybody else who'hoping to jump on, but we do have to to start wrapping things up. Just as a reminder for folks, though, if you did not get an opportunity to comment tonight, you may still submit written comments, and you can find more information on that on our website. So I'm going to go ahead and call Tom Walter. You may unmute. Okay. Can you hear me? Yes. All right, well, thank you very much, commissioners. Tom Walter to o m w a lte R. I'm a builder out of Eugene. I've been a part of developing in the Eugene area for over 30 years. First, I'd like to say that of all the utilities that I deal with when we try to develop, Northwest Naturill has been an excellent partner for how we do things. It's really challenging in our community to work with both the local agencies and the state agencies and the other utility companies. But Northwestast Natural is simply the easiest to work with of any, of any the people. We have to collaborate when we put together subdivisions. So it's just interesting. They make it. They make it, they make it easy. They've been a good partner, and I'm a believer in clean gas. That of all the fossil fuels that burn, natural gas burns far cleaner than anything. And we have a, we have a problem providing enough energy",

        "text": " conversations to come in between the budgeting process and the integrated resource plans and sort of that are complex and we'll need to keep making transparent in order to understand that question, but appreciate thinking through how these metrics serve us or need to be adjusted or expanded to understand a more complex landscape for the funding going forward. Great, thank you. Okay, let's go to the next slide. I do want to spend a moment here on renewables for next year, because actually we're planning on making some changes to our renewable, particular our residential solar program next year. So collect across the board, we are expecting to achieve 4.2 average megawatts of renewable generation. That is actually a decrease of 23% from our current 23 budget. This decrease really refcts, reflects more a change in our strategy and requirements, not particularly a softening of the market in 2024. We're proposing in this budget to focus the limited renewable dollars where they can really have the most impact, on serving customers equitably, on supporting resilience plan planning and projects, and supporting a more flexible grid. So we're planning on expanding activities to not only meet the requirements of House Bill 3141, to spend 25% of our funds collected to benefit customers with low and moderate incomes, but to really go far beyond that requirement. We are going to be focusing our solar within reach incentives, focusing our funding on our solar within reach incentives for income qualified customers who are installing solar on their homes. We're also bringing our expanding our solar ambassadors offer, which will be growing in 2024, really based on a very successful pilot in 2023. And we'll be continuing and expanding incentives for battery storage, and establishing a strategic approach to address residential solar financing in the market. So with these activities, we really, we expect to far exceed, as I mentioned, that minimum performance measure of 25%. And to do all of this, we will be phasing out our standard solar incentives for market rate residential customers, as the standard solar market really remains strong with high customer interest and with other sources of funding. So I think you're already seeing here some of the ways that we respond to other sources of funding. Of course, I'm proud to say that we played a very important role in helping to build the solar market in Oregon, and we are going to continue to support that market. We're actually going to do have a little bit of an increased budget of marketing, on customer education and on generating customer leads, and on trade ally business development to keep them supported that way. And of course, we'll continue supporting early development of hydropower and bioower projects, especially small hydropower projects, irrigation districts and biopower projects that can turn waste into energy, both of which benefit both rural and urban communities. And we do expect actually two hydropower projects to reach commercial operation in 2024. Okay, let's go on to the next slide. I am going to skip over this one. This just gives you a little bit of a list of some of the additional contracts energy trust is working on. If we have time at the end and you want more detail on these, I'm happy to provide it. Let's go to the next slide. This one just does just another way of looking at it. Our draft 2024 expenses by category and how they compare to 2023, as I've been mentioning by, you know, the biggest increase is our 2024 incentives, and then we have program delivery staff costs and internal costs. I'm going to go to the next slide and dig into the staff costs just a little bit more. So each year, as you know, the op stes annual performance measures for energy trust staffing and program delivery efficiency costs. Both performance measures were waived by the commission in 2023 to give energy trust, quote, the flexibility and capability to expand services. If there is increased demand for energy efficiency, whether that is because of a change in consumer demand or changes in utility needs to meet clean energy goals. And the OPC also stated that program delivery efficiency and staffing performance measures, quote, should not be a deterrent to energy trust adapting to serve customer needs at a time when the value of energy efficiency is increasing. So very appreciative of that recognition and that flexibility that it's given the organization. The commission has yet to determine our performance measures of qual course for 2024, and we do believe there's solid justification for either waivers or changes to these metrics, given the circumstances we're responding to in this draft budget. In the meantime, we are sharing information about our administrative and staffing costs in alignment with generally accepted accounting principles and nonprofit best practices. Even though we don't have an op performance measure specifically to demonstrate compliance with, we still wanted to show some form of good governance and good administration of ratepayer funds. So this, what we are showing includes reporting our administrative and staffing costs as a percent of total expenditures. We recognize that's",

        "text": " as opposed to the communities that perhaps have the most vulnerability? Thanks for that question. So as we've embarked on this process and done some of the initial thinking, one of the things that we've heard loud and clear from energy advocates and from others is that this needs to be a yes and approach and that this works best when PGE shows up as helpful. So as we're thinking about how we start acquisition of CBRRE throughout the balance of 2024 and beyond, we have started to coalesce on an RFP structure that instead of, you know, kind of moving things along quickly and getting into an answer, instead looks at where are those barriers and how have those barriers existed in the past and how can PGE show up in a way that helps to overcome those, whether it is funding, whether it is experience developing these sorts of projects in the past, how can we help kind of create those partnerships between community members and folks who are, are thinking about these projects? So our intent is for that to show up within the RFP itself, where we're getting proposals in the door and we're helping and kind of doing our part to build those connections and make sure that those are able to be successful and able to move forward. And then one of the things that we've also added in response to feedback from stakeholders in this process is that that shouldn't be the end of the story. And RFP can give us a good idea of what's in the market and what's out there today. It'll also highlight, frankly, I think things that we were hoping for that maybe didn't show up. And that's an opportunity for us to take more targeted action, to work directly with communities and to see how we can bring those to the forefront as this iterates over timeah. Okay, I appreciate that. And I know we don't want to get way down, further down the road on something that will come to us. But I that that connection back to who isn't showing up in the RFP is important. And I, much like PGE asks for in the EE space, would looks for ETo to be working with partners in the EE space. I think PGE really needs to take advantage of the partners in this space similarly to close those capacity. Ye, so thank you. Appreciate it. Yeah. And I guess I'm kind of hearing throughout this conversation that we're going to be paying attention to costs, and also this kind of effort is necessary to actually examine the opportunities of offsetting energy from fossil fuel with community based renewable energy. So I see that it's a little bit of a process of inquiry that's still going on, but a lot of progress to be looking at an RP. So. Thanks, Jacob. Okay, I see J. Jake Stevens wants to speak on CBR. Please raise your hand if you also would like to speak on the topic of community based renewable energy. Go ahead, Jake. Thank you, Charekker. Commissioner Tani, you. I appreciate the line of discussion there around how we're going to go about procuring these and scoring them. And, you know, building on my comments a second ago, you know, what I perceive here is I see these numbers that were just described. I think it was 155 mw by 2026. Know, respectfully, is chump change and kind of comical relative to the scale of opportunity that is available, including to the people that HB 2021 was supposed to benefit. The communities in Oregon know is defined throughout the statute in various ways. We have PGE needs 510 billion dollars of infrastructure generation side in order to comply with HP 2021. And we're talking about carving out something that candidly like, I could personally at NAN, build 160 CBR by two years from now, maybe a year from now. And the way this has gone down over the last couple of years is like we've squandered all of this time and focused it through a funnel that will essentially what I hear is going to go through PGE's bureaucracy as to what will be considered eligible, as opposed to leveraging the market to bring resources to bear at scale. And the vision that I think the commission should be focusing on here is there could be 500 million dollar projects all over the state which are providing resources that have batteries that are, you know, married up next to cooling and heating centers to handle emergency opportunities. Where we're building all of these things that have joint opportunities right now, I have no incentive or structure mechanism to really bring those forward because there is no mechanism to contemplate how they would be scored or preferred or any benefit aside from PGE's discretion and some unknown way. I really encourage you to think about how the RFP process could be opened up to facilitate this. And you've heard me say before, we need to score benefits. The state talked about those benefits. It is the policy of the state, the maximument is practical to pursue these types of benefits.",

        "text": "Good morning, everyone. Today is July 9, 2024, and we're here for a regular public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. All commissioners are present today, and we will start, as we always do, with an opportunity for public comment on items not listed on the agenda for discussion. Haven't heard that anyone wants to make public comment, but if you do, there's no need to sign up in advance. You can unmute yourself and make your comment. All right. Not hearing any public comment this morning. Commissioners, good morning. Let's move to the consent agenda. Good morning, Chair Decker, this is Commissioner Taney. I move we adopt the motions as outlined in each item on the consented. Good morning, Chairared Decker, this is Commissioner Perkins. I second the motion. I concur. The motion carries and the consent agenda is adopted. Thanks to all the staff who worked on those items. Okay. On our regular agenda today, we had art, a late edition of an item that was previously on the consent agenda and then had some comments filed and I think at least one public comment that going to be made in the meeting today. So while most of our agenda today is devoted to the review and decisions about acknowledgement of the utilities wildfire mitigation plans, we're going to delay that item briefly and take up the added item, which is regular agenda item five first. Ideally, we can move through that and move on to the wildfire mitigation plan portion of our meeting for ra five previously consent agenda item number two. I will invite Eric Schman for PC staff up to introduce the item related to Portland General Electric's renewable portfolio option. Good morning, Eric. Good morning, chair Decker, Commissioner Taney and commissioner Perkins. My name is Eric Schierman. I'm a senior utility analyst in the Energy resources and planning division. I'm joined by Natasha Smith and assistant attorney general with the Oregon Department of Justice. Staff recommends the commission approve PGE'advice number 20 411, in which the company proposes to remove references to green e certification, expand cancellation flexibility, and extend the contract for habitat restoration grants for PG's long standing portfolio options for residential schedule seven and small commercial schedule 32 customers. These portfolio options allow customers an option to pay an incremental fee to receive 100% renewable power and to fund local renewable projects. Staff is not aware of stakeholders that oppose these changes. However, the Green Energy Institute, or GEI, has concerns about how these voluntary portfolio products will be managed in the absence of greeny certification in response to the commission's February 2024 decision, in order number 240 zero two, the center for Resources Solutions, which runs the Greene e certification service for renewable energy credits or REx has decided to stop certifying Oregon based recs. PG states that it plans to operate portfolio options with the same level of integrity as previously provided by greeny certification. However, staff identifies that the absence of the established certification regime brings the potential for changes in transparency, with CR's no longer providing a trusted signal to customers. In written comments, GEI requests that the commission require PGE to procure recs of comparable quality to those certified by Greeny. GEI outlines criteria for commission verification of the REC placement and request that the commission require that the generation associated with these recs has been reported to DEQ for purposes of House Bill 2021 compliance. GEI would also like the commission to initiate a stakeholder process to ensure that accurate information is provided to Oregon regulated Oregon regulated voluntary purchasing programs staff agrees with GEI in the importance of ensuring a high level of integrity, transparency and clarity for these renewable products. Therefore, staff will take the following three next steps. First, staff will facilitate a discussion with PGE, GEI and other stakeholders to ensure that future products the company utilizes for its voluntary program have a high level of integrity, such as those certified by Greeney, and are clear to customers. Second, we will work to ensure the company's claims are accurate regarding how these products are certified and communicated to customers. And third, we will set the expectation that the company promptly update related marketing materials on its website and other channels. That concludes staff's summary of our recommendation and how we are addressing stakeholder interest in managing a post greeny future for PGE's well established portfolio options. Staff is happy to answer any questions like Commissioner already have. Fantastic. Thanks, Eric. Commissioners, any questions for Eric? Eric, I appreciate this and I appreciate you addressing Gei'comments. They raise, in particular the issue of regulatory surplus. That is, one piece of what a greeny certified rec presents is that there is this voluntary product is beyond any sort of regulatory compliance and that when you have a, you know, in other regimes, there's clear ways to do that. I think this is a space that's a little bit unclear today in HP 2021, which we",

And obviously there's been a multi year setback in a large scale here. The next thing I wanted to highlight in our request is that in addition to directing resumption of the RFP is that, and it appears that just the entire IRP and clean energy plan should be refiled. There's so many issues here at hard to imagine how it is updatable because you have such huge problems with major inputs and major assumptions. And also, again, as we brought up in the PGE RF IRP, the omission and suppression and limitation of various options. And I don't see in the IRP something over here in Bend where we have high desert solar resource, hundreds of megawatts or massive expansion of distributed generation pacific, or has a number of options here. Same things that we talked about before. There's a lot of options in state and a lot more that has been modeled and could be modeled and should be modeled and included. And so I think asking when they refile something that they increase the distributed generation in the state of Oregon, that they look at expansion of net metering programs and increasing the size, including to facilitate large commercial scale programs. They expand the on system modeling, they remove the caps from the community based initiatives and look at modeling expansions of community solar and what would happen if they did not restrict those to on system or 3. Make sure that the modeling properly evaluates everything that is indeed available. And again, I'll re highlight, while excluding the nuclear power plants that no one reasonably can presume will exist in 2031 and 32, given the without exception failure of all nuclear power plants in the United States to be even within a decade of the proposed schedules. And that concerns us in particular because effectively provides permission and acknowledgement, if that proceeds and is included inappropriately, to not procure thousands of megawatts, every megawatt of nuclear, multiply that times three, and that is how many megawatts of renewables are not being procured if they're going to presume that they will eventually be procuring that. So with that said, I think there were other comments by, by Max at renewables Northwest we supported there. Obviously, Sylvia Tanner was incredibly articulate on those issues, and we would only ask that you do more to formally expand and maybe even consider an expression of the continual progress standard applying to those as well, because we think there's a huge opportunity removing the caps on those projects and making sure that they're evaluated. And again, in terms of expanding and making sure all the options on the table looking at how Purpa could be expanded and enabled, because effectively, both utilities have now demonstrated that relying on them and their pace of procurement and their discretion and how they administer that is not a reliable path to secure continual progress. And I think the commission has an obligation to look at how we expand the number of doors and pathways that are available to succeed and contribute to the success of the state on HP 2021 decarbonization standards. Thank you. Appreciate your comments. Any questions for Jake today? No. I appreciate your comments. Thanks for showing up and, and let us know your perspective. Is there anyone else that would like to make public comments today? If you can't find the raise your hand feature, feel free to unmute and not hearing anyone. Let's give a Pacific Corp. Their chance to respond to what we've heard today. Good afternoon. Can everybody hear me? O there it goes, my camera. Good afternoon, Commissioner Tawy and chair Decker. I am joined here today. Well, for the record, my name is Thomas Burns. I'm vice president of resource planning and acquisitions here at Pacific Corp. I'm also joined by several subject matter experts across the company, and we are prepared to respond as needed when that time arrives. The company submitted its comments on staff reports on February 14, which included an appendix summarizing our responses to each one of the 13 recommendations today. Iish to concentrate on certain staff recommendations that are particularly troubling from the company's viewpoint, specifically, the suggestions that the company must resubmit at CEP and IRP and begin the acknowledgement process anew as the result of changes and circumstances following the submission of these resource plans, most notably the stay of the ozone transport rule, these recommendations are of significant concern to the company. The basis for these recommendations appears to be the notion that an IRP or CEP should not be judged as a snapshot of resource planning at the time of filing, but rather a streaming, continuous resource planning event, with post submission shifts in external circumstances being grounds for non acknowledgement or further proceedings. We believe this notion is flawed and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the IRP and CEP. These plans require the",

        "text": " the five page type of thing that MIDAP mentioned. But I think we'll need to discuss as well and see what other parties think. Thanks. Hi, Ron. Te, oh, yep. No, go ahead. Sorry. Ted, this is Chris Brmer from Pacific Corps. Can you hear me? Yes. Yeah, I just wanted to go back to what Stephanie asked earlier about other states. I can say that, you know, Pacific Corps has know we operate in six of the western states. There's not another commission or staff that has asked for anything like this in my experience. So just for what that's worth, the other states, the Pacific or operates, and we don't, we don't have any sort of policy like that. This is, Brian, if I could just note, there's only been a few states that have really adopted 1547 2018. So this is kind of a new concept. So Minnesota and New Mexico are the only places that have put those requirements in a manual, say, instead of the rule itself. And so that's, that's why the, you know, it's kind of coming up as this new concept. Maybe one potential solution here is for ireac to identify the provisions that it thinks should be made as a filing. And it sounds like that could be much narrower than the entire interconnection handbook, which we had concerns with being filed. And that way we're looking at a much smaller universe of items. And maybe that's something that all the other parties might be able to get on board with, just throwning out a potential compromise there. Yeah, I think we could do that. I, I guess I start by saying it's what's under preferred default settings in the, in the rules. And I'll take a second, you know, after the workshop to consider if there's anything else. I don't know if Mhatt and Brian know off the top of their head if there is. And the only other thing I want to add to this conversation is for the large investor owned utilities in California, which does not include Pacificoreps, this level of detail is included in the interconnection rules itself. We don't think we need to go there, but I just wanted to note that as well. And we'll also be mid health rep pilot. We'll also be happy to share some like for example, New Mexico already shared draft versions of their tirs that they are filing ahead in ten days from now. So we don't have the formal version that they will fil, but they sent draft versions and we were able to share some feedback and so on that they got wrong in their specification. So I'be. I'm sure we can share those draft versions in mind that they're not the official version. To give you an idea what all these would mean if they're getting filed, I'd definitely be interested in seeing those mid hat Heidi. Looks like you have your hand up. Yeah, I did. And I wanted to just reflect on when I was thinking of a handbook as a, as a, you know, kind of like a. An aid. I was thinking of something very similar to the electric service requirements books that the utilities have as not a kind of a negotiating document, but more about a practical application document. With if you're PGE, how do you make the NESC and other aspects of your utility functional for a contractor, a new customer, whatever it might be, or if you're Pacific core, what sort of conventions are appropriate for your system? So I was thinking of it in that light, not necessarily as a rule enforcement document. It feels to me like as it's being talked about here, it has a different kind of tone behind it than I guess I was thinking of. So I don't know if it's worth continuing to kind of go down the path that it felt like maybe Stephanie and others were talking around, which is like the why and what is this particular document versus the rules versus if I'm trying to understand how to build a project and what sort of, what sort of conventions are appropriate in that this part of that of their system, what things do I need to incorporate into my project so it can meld into that system properly? So I was viewing it slightly differently. It feels like to me anyway, go ahead Iran, your hand is up. Yeah, I was going to move on to some of the other aspects of staffs proposal, but didnt know if anyone wanted to respond to it was just said not hearing anything. Appreciate staffs attempt to come up with a compromise here. I think there's three aspects of staff's proposal that, that do not include the recommendations that we had made, and I think those are specification of what is required for notice or a requirement that notice be provided to customers, information on how a formal comment process would work, and a formal limit onilities the ability of the utility to make changes and to prevent them from making changes that are not related to safety or reliability or adverse system impacts on those three",

        "text": " screen used than what you would find in supplemental review. Although we have been able to staceacy if you could pull up, go up to the penetration screen and supplemental review. We have in some other states looked at having a less conservative screen within, you know, within the tiers at. At 100%, but not including the specific calculations that you'll find in little roman numeral one through three. So it's kind of, one might say kind of more crude 100% because it doesn't have to have those individual calculations U associated with ITM. And, you know, that's something we've seen u. You know, be successfully used inm in some other states. And it's something that, you know, if we can't reach a compromise or consensus here that, you know, that we'd consider proposing for, you know, for Oregon to use in their screens as well. But I wanted to start off, you know, I was hoping that, you know, we could, you know, perhaps reach some sort of compromise or consensus on 90%, in which case Ira could support it. Brian, do you want to say a little bit more about this? Yeah, I don't know that there's really anything to add. I think you noted that it's kind of crude. You know, basically the, if it were 100%, it would only be 100% at the, you know, the minimum load hour of the year. And so, you know, much fewer potential issues would arise there than if you're looking even more granular, unlikely to even ever balance the load generation and load. But, no, I don't think there's anything more to say then. Another thing we didn't include here, but we were able to successfully advocate for in Illinois, was a requirement that the utilities collect minimum load data for all feeders within one year of adopting the new rules. And so that, you know, that's something that the Illinois commission has as a part of their orders. So within the next year, all the Illinois utilities are gonna be collecting minimum load data for each feeder so that they can use minimum low data instead of the 15% of peak. Again, that's not something we've included in this compromise proposal, but we do think that that's kind of a best practice, that if we don't go to compromise as something that the commission should consider as well. And with that, I'll open it up. I'll just say that the mandate for being able to collect minimum load is probably more appropriately dealt with in our distribution system planning docket, because rather than in these interconnection rules, I know the different utilities are differently situated on how much of their system has different capabilities and different sort of SCADA capabilities. And it is sort of being talked about pretty extensively in distribution system planning. So developing a. This compromise sort of how you calculate 90% is probably appropriate here. And allow sort of the SCADA rollout discussion to sort of mature in that other venue. Yeah, you know, I don't think. I mean, it seems logical. I haven't heard any specific concerns with this as the preliminary screen in the. As how we set this preliminary screen. During the initial sort of fast track review at level one and level two. You know, it's defaults. Basically the 90% which is where line is in the sand. There is sort of some of that overarching concern on the dedicated transformers. With the 80% where we know it's going to be a problem. Or we know there may be a problem with the three v stuff, but we'll capture it in the supplemental. Well, this will prevent us from being able to capture. To get to that additional screen to address that issue. So there is some concern with that sort of one circuit, one substation transformer. And the need to take into consideration that 80% for voltage. So I mean, I guess the real compromise position would be to, you know, to throw in the 80% four circuits that are with a dedicated transformer or. I don't know if that's a compromise that if it's just what we ask for. But so it's something to consider. I mean, we've addressed the issue that 80% is a newer standard coming out where. And the issue is the substration transformer for the transformer loading. And this doesn't reflect that concern. This also does have a mandatory approval process in it. So it's a bit concerning not to. Not to set the line at the most conservative level here. Eric, just for our edification, would you mind explaining what. What would need to be done to collect minimum load information? That's, you know, kind of like the worst case scenario. I'm assuming that you have a feeder where you're able to collect maximum load information. Is it just a matter of data tracking or is there actually equipment reconfiguration that somehow needs to be done? I think like say that different utilities have different capabilities and everybody's looking to capture this data. I mean, I think",

        "text": " mentioning, but just, you know, for illustrative purposes, wanting to address that. M using these as the examples. But DSM and QFs are areitis. So those are easy to do coal then it depends. It could be a large amount of coal or a small amount of coal or no coal eventually. And then you move to gas and then you kind of address the gas. So the gas you would still have system shared and cyitis, cyitis. DSM, QFs, shared coal potentially gas potentially. Gas may be more system. Some of the resources may be system, some may be shared coal. It depends on exit dates. And then you would move to non emitting. Non emitting would stay system. And so what that does by keeping the non emitting as system is allow Pacific Core to still plan to get the best resources for its non emitting resour for its entire system. And those non emitting resources, because you're netting against load would go to serve certain loads in a greater allocation percentage in the near term as Pacific or decarbonizes its entire system. So in the near term, if that state is out of coal and then just for simplicity purposes, say also out of gas, so they've got 900 mw netted against QFS and DSM. Those would all be served by non emitting for the near term. While other states might be served. They might only have 100 mw that are served by the non emitting because they have 800 mw that are served by a combination of gas and coal netd against the same 100 for DSM and qfs. But over time, as Pacificoree retires those coal resources, more of the non emitting would move over and we would meet that additional system need through additional non emitting resources. And. Sorry, I just have to ask, is this just based on sort of a. Well, normally when we think of cost recovery we're depreciating a lot more costs more early because there's more to depreciate. Can you address why the early states wouldn't be. That is one of the many factors that we are still trying to work through. You how do we do that? So that kind of the early states, the states that are kind of taking more of that allocation of anony em meding are paying more upfront and then less as they go. So we've got to figure that out. We also have to figure out the offsetting potential PTC benefits, you know, for as long as we can get those with new resources. How do you balance that? That is still one of the issues and there are an enormous amount of issues that we. Because it does get very complex to start thinking about this in a way that meets each one of the state's requirements. But the dynamic methodology does allow us to continue to decarbonize. And then from Pacific course perspective it allows us to maintain the benefits of low diversity across our system, the geographic diversity across our system to try to address all of those issues. So, but at the same time we continue to look at the fixed allocation methodology. We're continuing to look at just the more simplified kind of system, partially shared Cytus. But we, you know, this something, the additional wrinkle that Pacific core is going of put on the table is this idea of that fuel type can allow for kind of the shifting of non emitting resources to one state in the near term and then moving later. But yes, the depreia, the depreciable lives, the upfront costs, the PTCs along with the idea of the reliability of the system making sure that there's adequate each customers in each state are paying for kind of the reliability system, their share of the reliability of the system. Pacific Corps also believes there are some other benefits of this in that kind of maintaining some partial allocation of gas also is essentially hedge is probably not the right word, but it may be prudent because we have so much new technology assumptions as we get out to 90% or 100% renewable. How do you deal with that? And you know, we have battery technology right now, but we have battery technology for, you know, 4 hours, 6 hours. Maybe we get to 8 hours. But you know, there's times when we may need it for days, you know, or a full week. And so how do you balance all of that out? So those are all issues that we're still trying to address in this. And I, you know, we're continuing to work on that, but it does get very complicated, especially when we are looking at trying to also use this allocation methodology to show compliance out for, you know, 2030, 2035 and 24 for organs case and even longer for some of the other states. So we don't have all of the answers. Now can irt of say back to you what I think you're saying about what is different about what you're proposing and see if I'm",

Let's go ahead and jump to the next slide again just to get providing some context about some of the challenges that we encountered in putting together our long, both our short and our longer term sort of resource strategies to both meet our emissions targets and our customers energy needs and doing this planning at this point in time when our entire sector as I'm sure everyone is aware, is under a tremendous amount of dynamic change, and there's a fair amount of uncertainty that that imparts then in the planning environment. If we look at the picture to the right, that is a clear depiction of sort of how across the west, it's not just Oregon is obviously moving very rapidly to decarbonize, and this is a really good thing, of course, but it presents challenges in terms of sort, you know, for all utilities in the region, in terms of planning sufficient transmission and being able to cite resources where they need to be located, and certainly managing collectively for resource adequacy, as we're all collectively trying to decarbonize. The picture on the bottom is just a reminder of sort of HP 2021 set legislative targets for the power sector to achieve emissions reductions. But at the same time, Oregon is also moving forward through the regulatory process operated out of DEQ and their climate protection program to drive emissions reductions in related sectors, primarily in transportation and use natural gas and in the industrial sector. And obviously, there are dynamic interactions between the emissions reductions that will happen in those sectors and what that means in terms of the electric sectors and PGE specifically are future energy needs and how we will meet those future energy needs that we had to account for. And then, of course, you add on to that know the very welcome injection of federal support, which in many ways is being characterized as a game changer as far as sort of the clean energy transition nationally with the IRA and the IHA, and as that money begins to make its way through either to our customers directly or to the utility, that will change both the pace of clean energy technology adoption, the development of new technologies, all of which at this point, we do the best we can do to model based on what we know today. But we know that the current environment is highly uncertain and will continue to evolve. So just wanted to sort of name some of those challenges and issues that we had to consider as we engaged in this resource planning process. Next slide, please. Okay, so as we thought about our path to particularly those 2030, that first emissions target timeline that the utilities required to hit the 80% reduction below our 2010 to 2012 baseline levels of emissions, the utility has articulated a decarbonization strategy that's really multifaceted. At the simplest level, our strategy to reduce emissions involves sort of being able to go out and acquire sufficient non emitting energy and capacity resources to be able to replace fossil fuel generations serving our retail customers on our system. And when we have that sufficient non emitting energy and capacity available to the utility that's when we can systematically reduce fossil fuel generation to serve those customers while maintaining, you know, reliability and affordability. And then throughout this process, of course, is our commitment and to work with our customers to help them manage their energy wallet, not only as part of the decarbonization of the power supply, but as part of that larger energy transition that we've talked about that's taking place where many of our customers are rapidly turning to, you know, electric vehicles or otherwise beginning to electrify their homes and businesses. So how do we work with them to manage their overall energy wallet during this transition? To do that, we've kind of identified some enabling strategies. First and foremost, obviously, clean energy acquisition. And as you see in our filing, that involves, and we'll talk about this in much greater detail in just a bit that involves not only the more traditional sort of large utility scale renewable energy resources and batteries, but increasingly it comes to mean more community and customer sideited solutions as a key part of our decarbonization strategy, not just things that our customers want, but also things that are important to our ability to hit those emission reduction targets in 2030 and beyond. Transmission, as you see in the filing, is a critically important part of this story, and we'll come back and talk a little bit more about that in a bit. We also see our work collaborating across the region and participating in organized markets as critically important in order to meet those decarbonization targets. Access to a",

        "text": "Good morning. Today is March 7, 2023, and we were here for a regular public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. All commissioners are present and will start, as we always do, with an opportunity for public comment on items not listed on the agenda for discussion today. Didn't hear that. Anyone wish to make a public comment? But if someone does, please go ahead and mu yourself and introduce yourself right. Not hearing any public comments. Let's move to the consent agenda and, noting a couple changes in removals, take action on what's left on the most recently updated consent agenda. Good morning, chair. I move that we adopt the recommendations as set forth in each memo for items that remain on the consent agenda. Good morning. This is Commissioner Tanei. I want to recognize how much hard work the water staff'been doing. There's water really substantial water cases have been trickling by on the consent agenda, and they really represent an, an enormous listift by the Ste Yamada in particular. So recognizing thattt happy to second, I concur in the recognition and the motion and the consent agenda is adopted. We've got a full agenda today, not a ton of decision making items, at least until later in the agenda. But we do have a number of important informational updates on actions around federal funding, the PUc'own diversity, equity and inclusion framework, and updates on the utility, community benefits and impacts advisory group. So we'go through those in order. And I do want to note that for time management purposes, we're not gonna, especially with the first one, have really much space for question and answer. We will all be learning here. And we're so grateful in this first agenda item to have the opportunity to hear from so many entities who have been active in the historic opportunity for federal funding in the energy space. This is a really important moment over the next year to leverage these opportunities. And I'm really grateful to Kesha Brockman for of PUC executive office for keeping us organized on this and developing a list of presenters that can give us a landscape overview of this important topic. Write down your questions, hold your questions, anticipate this being an active part of discussion across the state of Oregon over the coming months and year. So with that, I will invite Keasa to come on up and kick off the presentation. Kristy Collins will be pulling up and advancing the slides for the different elements of this presentation. After Keacia, we will hear presentations from PGE Pacific Corp. Idaho PoweR, Oregon Department of Energy and Energy Trust, and we have about 45 minutes for this segment of the meeting. Good morning and take it away. Keshia thanks. Good morning, Chair Decker, Commissioner Tani and Commissioner Thompson. My name is Kesha Brockman, commission policy advisor at the PUC, and as the chair said, I'm here with a team of folks today to provide an update on a substantial federal climate and energy incentives. We've got six, hopefully quick presentations lined up for you. I will start by laying out the new funding most relevant to the electricity sector. Then the electric utilities will describe the opportunities they're pursuing. The Oregon Department of Energy will discuss energy related funding available to the state. And finally, we'll hear how energy trust is leveraging the federal fund. Next slide, please. There are two landmark bills. First is the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs act of 2021, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This funding helps build physical infrastructure to support the clean energy transition. It's mostly in the form of grants available over five years, typically ending in fiscal year 2026. 2nd is the Inflation Reduction act, which creates incentives for the market to adopt efficient and zero emissions technology. And these are typically a combination of tax incentives and grants. Funding under both of these bills emphasize job creation and wages benefits for disadvantaged communities and domestic manufacturing. Next slide the remaining slides show tables listing the funding from both bills available to states, utilities, project developers, and end users. The right column lists the bill and section number for reference, and I've organized these by Technology for transportation. Electrification funding is available to build electric vehicle charging infrastructure and to put more ev's on the road. ODOT will receive formula grants where the amount is set by a formula to build charging infrastructure and other greenhouse gas reduction measures, and the agency is taking the steps necessary to secure these grants. For Oregon, ODOT's National Electric Vehicle infrastructure Ory plan was approved, and charger installations could begin later this year. ODOT will submit its carbon reduction plan for approval in November, and that may include additional charging elements activities. Additionally, the IRA extends the tax credit for residential and commercial EV charger installations, modifies it to allow bi directional charging equipment, and encourages labor standards for EV purchases. The IRA modifies the clean vehicle tax credits to impose income limits and domestic production and content requirements",

        "text": " currently written, which is the other way. So I highlight that as something I bet we all can come to consensus to reflect reality on some change language for the definition of written notice. Eric, do you offer to provide a new definition? I can doctor up that definition and send it around pretty easy, I think. You know, Ted, they had some other ways pulled out, but I will try and doctor that definition and send it over to the parties. You're the best. Thanks, Eric. Okay, well, with that we can move on to the interconnection after passing screens. Now there is need for a process after passing the fast track screens, so's we've incorporated it. Currently utilities are required to provide an executable interconnection agreement no later than five business days after the date of approval. So we've incorporated that into this change into staff's proposal. And so one other change that is incorporated here, that is a process change, but it seems helpful is the requirement that the interconnection agreement be executed by the utility when sending it out. I think it's minor change that could be helpful in streamlining the process, but would like to hear if there are concerns. Ted, this is Jordan. I think we might have had some questions and or concerns about that change, but I don't know that I'm the best person to articulate them. But if no one else speaks up, I can try, I can try. I think this is relatively narrow and maybe there's not too much problem if there are no sort of conditions precedent in or when they are, when we're providing the executed contract. So if it's like a no concerns, interconnect your project, we don't care. I mean, not that we don't care that we have no additional issues that need to be ironed out. This may not be problematic to provide an executed contract from the utility side. It gets a little more problematic if there are things like deposits due for interconnection upgrades or things like that where we would want that deposit condition met prior to the contract being fully executed. Because if the we sign the contract, then the customer signs the contract, then doesn't meet on there, doesn't provide the deposit, you know, now it's a breach issue or potentially a breach issue, or maybe it isn't, but we just got to feel how that flows through some of the more if there's other conditions to meet, if that becomes changes, how the project would flow. So more to come on if we are concerned with the executed agreement there. So like I say, I don't think it's problematic when there's nothing that needs to be done may be problematic if there are stuff that the customer developer needs to do to sort of initiate the contract. So. And now, Jordan, please save me from what I said wrong there. Well, I think the best thing you said was more to come because we just need to dig in a little more. But just wanted to flag at this point that we do have some questions. Okay, I appreciate that, and I appreciate the concerns raised. Yoki, you've got your hand up. Yeah. I just wanted to point out that this is after passing the tier one screens, and I have a hard time imagining situation where a project passes the tier one screens and anything else would be required. I could see it in the situation of the next section where it's approval despite screen failure, where, oh, you failed to screen. Here's the minor modification you need to fix. We need the deposit, you know, in order to, uh, you know, get that started. But where it's, where the project just strictly passes the screen, you know, as you think about it, it would be good if you could come up with an example of when something else would be required, because I have a hard time imagining what that would be. Yeah. Oh, I was just going to say, yoki. I. We were. I think Eric's comments and mine were more generally reflecting that this change shows up in a number of places throughout the rules not specific to tier one. I think it even maybe shows up in tier four. Certainly it's in there several times. And I think we agree with your perspective. For a tier one project that passes, probably not problem, because you're right. But making sure that figuring out how it flows through all the rulesict, if we sign first, is we just got to think through it. Yeah, sounds good. Then the other thing I would say, ted, is just what's reflected on the spreadsheet didn't end up in your red line that you distributed specifically the deleting that last phrase at the time the results are provided. So just wanted to flag that to you. Thanks, Joie. Appreciate that. So those are the three examples I had of process changes. I've got the positionian matrix up. I've got the red lines. I know, Jordan, you had some process things you wanted to discuss, so I'll turn",

        "text": " in the rates, I can't change in my avoided cost work paper without going back to the IRP process. And then I just also wanted to highlight that the work paper template that we used in our filing, that's the same template work paper we've been submitting for the last ten years. And it complies with all the order commission orders on how to calculate avoided costs. And we didn't change anything in the work paper we just updated with the 2023 IRP inputs and the new gas prices and the new forward curves. I also want to say that, you know, a lot of the stuff's been brought up we're looking forward to discussing in, um, 2000. And then finally we concur with staff that we did, did comply with the LC 80 order on the QF renewal rate. And we're happy to answer additional questions on that if commissioners have questions. Okay, anything you want to add, Arion, on behalf of PGE, before we take questions from the commission? Yes, hi, good morning, this is Erin Apperson. On behalf of PGE. Just wanted to, again, to add on to what Mister Plaza just talked about. Just that we've heard a whole host of issues being raised today, and we've expedited discoveryest responses to some of the QF participants to try to make sure that they have information leading up to this public meeting. And just would want to note that, you know, the vast array of issues that have been raised seem most appropriately handled in, um, 2000. And it would not seem appropriate to just kind of pick some sort of number in this docket or to run a parallel process here outside of the scope of the larger work that's being done there. That would be an inefficient use of resources, that we'd be really concerned around that kind of process. So just, again, wanted to. We hear all of the issues that are being raised today, but we do think that there is an appropriate place to be discussing those. Thank you. Okay, any questions for the company? I appreciate the point that the inputs for this filing come from the IRP. And I also appreciate the point others are making that the IRP is not a perfect source. Sometimes its proxy values were adopted early in the IRP process. So it's been a while since they've been updated there. Also, the IRP can't fine tune necessarily every methodological detail in the decision making that we do for acknowledgement. I regard those as a little bit questions to be taken into the, um, 2000 process. But one question that I do have about the translation from the IRP to the avoidedid cost filing has to do with this concept that four hour battery is the capacity resource. That it seems like something that in the IRP there's, let's see, a portfolio of resources that combine to meet PGE's capacity needs. And I just wanted to understand a little bit better in response to the to why sort of a four hour battery, as opposed to know something else that was sort of part of that portfolio was selected. I think there's a fairly clear answer to that, but I just wanted to elevate that explanation from the company on this point. Sure. Thank you for the question. I'll try and respond and then Seth can jump in if he has additional detail. But basically, the value of capacity outside of portfolio analysis is calculated by developing the net cost of capacity. So the net cost of capacity is the cost required to get 1 capacity contribution from the next leastase cost capacity resource available to meet capacity needs. So in the 2023 IRP, it was determined that the next least cost of capacity resource available to meet the near term capacity need was a four hour battery. Hello, Commissioner. Seth Wiggins. I managed the IRP team. Just want to add to Chris's explanation there. The avoided capacity resources has never been a purely quantitative exercise. The simple cycle combustion turbine was chosen as the avoided capacity resource for years, even though it wasn't the least cost resource that provided dispatchable capacity. So the combined cycle was always, or at least since I've been around it, it was always cheaper, but on a net cost basis. But it was never added there to this def designation. So there's always some amount of arbitrariness, or at least there has been in the determination of that avoided cost resource. Now there's plenty to discuss in the UM 2000 1893 phase two context about that choice. You're absolutely right that with renewable penetration increasing, really the designation between that capacity resource we start bleeding over, especially when the capacity contribution of that battery is so dependent on the energy resources and vice versa. We heard a lot today in this meeting about potentially counterintuitive ELCC results to which the company'happy to respond. But a lot of them have to do with what system you're evaluating, what resource, at what time, and all the intricacies there. So",

        "text": " So last year, we did additional investments in some of our generation facilities to ensure that particularly the thermal units, which are under tremendous stress when the temperatures are really hot, had good operational capabilities. And that was actually changes that we made in our capital planning based on the high heat dome and high heat experiences that we had in 2021. And they absolutely paid dividends in 2022. We also make sure that we have safe and compliant to the standards, whether they be OPUC standards, whether they be national electric code standards of our distribution system, our transmission system, and that we're taking care to ensure that there are no there, that our equipment is fully compliant and en robust. I would also say that we take a look at those areas where we can make investments that will have a return. So many of our systems investments actually have a pretty good return because they allow us to do our work more effectively, more efficiently, to deploy capital only to where it's needed. So even some of our AI technologies and others where we're looking really at some of the frequency deviations, we can get ahead of things rather than do things on a break fix basis. And that will dramatically lower our overall cost of procurement. We're spending more time really looking at multi year programs so that we can hire workforces that will optimize through the predictability of that, as well as obviously competitive bidding. There's no question that some of our software technology investments pretty much almost everything by the end of this year, except for that that's reliability based, will be in the cloud, and that's giving us tremendous opportunities to do a better job on real time data analytics. So we're combining really what's required of us as a utility provider, the changing environment we have, as well as taking the opportunity to really leverage technology and data and really also be able to extend the life of our assets as well. Larry, do you want to add to that and speak more specific of how you run the CRG? No. You ran through a number of those really important measures. Again, compliance we have to meet, and we want to make sure that in all ways that we are there? And then we start to think about risk and risk, meaning the assets that what's going to be impacted, how many customers, what might be the outcome if that device does fail? And you, how quickly do we, and when should we be replacing that? And, you know, old methodologies were kind of time based. And now we're really looking at the operational characteristics and understanding the devices and monitoring, looking for any sort of data that tells us when that might fail. And how do we get ahead of that? Because it's a whole lot cheaper to change it the day before it fails versus the day it does fail. On top of that, we look at the growth, what our customers are looking for and expansion, and then transforming the business. And much of the transform is, I will say it turns out to be capital for operational cost in many cases. And Maria was just bringing up software as one of those great examples. And I'm thinking about how we're now, I mentioned the frequency reserves and we were bottom performers in WEC, and we were concerned with the power pool there for a while. We're now top performer because we applied some data analytics capability that showed us how to operate better. What did that do? That freed up generation not to have to have as much spinning reserves. And we're using our virtual power plant, the distributed standby generators and batteries, to fill that need and free up the generation on the other side so it's available for us to be able to use during these capacity constraint periods. Another good example, just in running the energy imbalance market, I could think of Pam Sporberg's team and how they're taking data. We invest a little bit and we all suddenly see a lot more of the data and the analysis automatically with Cal ISO, and we're reducing much of our cost with them on the energy imbalance, our return on the investment is really high with how we operate in the energy and balance market and our performance there. So we keep looking for these areas that we can transform the business, put in the data, the automation, simplify in many ways so we don't have people that are, you know, having to re key in information. John Kocvar has been really good about looking at those types of operations that we can simplify our business. And then I think the other part of our capital is to think about not only the renewables and the expansion there, how we're executing on each one of those projects. And so we've been advancing ourselves and looking at our project management teams and how they operate and make sure that we're executing on those in a timely fashion. And, you know, I will just say our performance in years past wasn't as good as it could be. And so we're moving, advancing that way so we can do more capital, in fact, if we're executing better",

So unless we start requiring customers to have a storage and never use it, so it's available for Black Star, this is going to be a complicated one to get because then we'll have to show to NRC how is our black c capability? Just that is part of a standard from Nerk. So there's no a whole lot of wiggle room into there. You just have to follow all those neare rules. And for that part, and that's totally fair, I think. But figuring out how to making it available, ensuring that is available, I think is worthwhile. And we're also thinking of things like biodiesel units and so forth. All right. Greatly appreciative of everyone's comments thus far. Let's see. I think the interest of time, we might. Sorry, Ryan, one more thing on the capacity stuff. I know at least Portland, you know, is supporting some of their capacity and dispatchability needs based on hydro that's available from some of the Pud in Washington. And so I feel like there's also a reference point relative to that that should be considered. And I guess part of my context here is t and talk to a number of esses that are major players in the market. Their perspective is that the IOU need for capacity and the ability to pass that through the rateayers is functionally a blank check to bid outbid anybody and everybody in the market, to the point that I think it's a concern about their businesses, you know, as a larger regional ess players. So I think transparency and consideration of that so that that doesn't slip through the cracks if the utilities are playing massively above market prices or driving those prices up, that somehow that's not potentially being avoided by. By qs. And it's not inconceivable, for example, for an 80 megawatt QF, to have a four hour battery that could be providing much of the same service, for example, or smaller one. Andresas, was your hand left up, or is this a new comment? Andres, are you there? Okay. Dan McNeil? Sure. So just a couple things here. One, you know, and given all the discussion today, there is a lot of nuance, right, that, you know, what's happened since our IRP, what's happening in the different mix of resources that were picked, how plausible are they, you know, setting avoided costs based on specific circumstances, instead of just locking in whatever the utility may have assumed in its IRP. I'm not horribly opposed to that. If we have a reason discussion about it, and don't just try to follow in lockstep rules that we establish right now. But it's messy, like, prepare to be a deluge of discussion about it. That's one thing. We'll just leave that there. The other one is on payment structure b. Four if you wanna flip to that one. On the right side, it says capacity payment baked in based on NURC HLH hours. And I would suggest, I think there's an opportunity here to refine and target those hours, not just for the premium peak that we have for hybrid solar storage resources, but more generally speaking, to really identify these are the valueable hours and these are not so much if we can make that distinction. I don't need an irrigation hydro project to deliver to me all day long to get that value. If you can give me 6 hours, that's practically like that premium peak resource that we have compensating in the hybrid one. There's opportunities there, and it may be easy enough to do that in a standard rate, even if they wouldn't try to do it know for a non standard or they have concerns about it. So consider whether setting an on peak and off peak definition that isn't NRK HLH is appropriate. And we've talked about this a bit in the past in our standard rates right now, we actually just threw out the HLH LLH distinction because HLH was lower than LLH and that wasn't making a lot of sense. There's definitely opportunity to make that better. And we do use in several states different on peak definitions to help target the value and pay it out when it is actually worth it. So just flag that one as something that ought to be considered. Dan, this is Scott. Can I ask follow up real quick. Curious, is that just in relation to the capacity payments, or is there also differences in how you do energy payments from Hoh and lh? Yep, it's actually both. And we really calculate what the avoided cost is and then spread it out across an on peak, in an off peak definition, so that we make sure we provide all the compensation that's due, but with a timing that, you know, incensed the QF to perform in the periods that it's most valuable to do so, and differentiates the differences across the day and across the year. So, you know, it's more of a rate spread kind of an",

        "text": ", we now have another source of funding, and that is all of the advantages of the Inflation Reduction act and the investment in Jobs act. And those funds will really help offset both the impact of customer prices as well as, as the needs for external fundraising. And so to balance out what is a high growth period of time, we're really being very focused on bringing that kind of funding into our utility and into the state of Oregon. And we have a number of really important and exciting projects that we're working on. So I hope that we look at it as a balance of everything. But at the end of the day, it all starts with our customers and serving them. Thank you, Marie. I appreciate that. Thank you, chair, of course, Commissioner Tawi, anything from your end? Thanks so much. A couple of questions. I'curious, in past updates and before COVID pulled our attention so much away, you had been really putting forward a vision for how you were going to use resources in the footprint, you know, in terms of demand response and the smart grid test bed and so on. And while we have, you know, sort of filings and so on around those pieces, I wonder particularly Larry, it strikes me that you had really put forward a vision of how you were going to think about those resources. How is that playing out? How is that evolving? I see in the federal funds list a lot of interesting sort of projects connected into that, but I'm curious how that vision has evolved in the intervening time span. Thank you, commissioner ton. A great question. And the vision is still there and we are still moving in that direction. And Maria reminds me at times that, you know, that was five years ago that we kind of, as you say, started this. And when we put that strategy together and here we are, we're still moving ahead with the virtual power plant. That's the term we tend to use. We learned so much from our distributed sandby generation in terms of how we operate. We're now using that for our spinning reserves as well as contingency reserves and frequency response. And so as we bring on batteries, we see just huge benefits for us to be able to continue. And one of those projects I mentioned, we're interviewing on Friday of this week, tomorrow or excuse me, this Friday, we are interviewing with the DoE for that wind solar battery control system, which we've brought in PNNL, Washington State University and a number of other manufacturers to work in cooperation with us to optimize and see how it impacts transmission flow as well as the operation of those units together. But we are moving forward with the customer side of that as well. And so what is now roughly 225 virtual power plant. We need to expand that. We need to expand it quickly. I still see a future in our target, the capacity of coming from the distribution system by 2030 of 25% of our requirements, which is about 1600. So we have really, really aggressive targets in that space. I think you've given us the tone and direction as well in support of that. So we are continuing. We're talking about our communication systems and how we work with devices. So there's a big effort in light of communication network, but we are really trying to work hard thinking of our customers. EV's how we flex load is going to be really important as we go forward. And even buses, if you can get 6 kw from a bus back end into the system, school bus, when it's off duty or not being used, those are really, really great and important elements of our grid as we go into the future. So I'm very excited about it still. Commissioner Tanei, and as you talked about the federal dollars, we do have a project in there on the autonomous, I like to think of it the autonomous grid edge and with Nvidia and utility data that we're pressing forward with, that I think is really going to again uplift us to the next level of what is the utility of the future and think of plug and play. So I want, when devices are plugged in, it's kind of like your USB. It's known, it's understood, and it's influenced by the grid without any impact on customer experience. We want that to be still, you know, what comfort and what customers are looking for, but is a real balance. We're learning a lot. We have a lot of great partners out there. And as Maria, and Maria was being a little bit, I think playing down that she'll be the chair for EP this coming year. And so, you know, she'll be helping to drive research as well as what she's doing with the Department of Energy. So it's very exciting time for us. I think PGE is seen as a leader in this space. We want to continue to do that. Mister n Ty. I would add that on everything that we've done over",

        "text": "I'm a senior utility analyst in the utility strategy and integration division. Joining me today from staff R. Scott Gibbons, Ted Drennin and here. We don't quite have staff counsel on and caroline more will possibly be joining us later. You are just joining us or have not done so already. Please take a moment to introduce yourself in the chat by sharing your name and the organization that you represent. If you're not already on the service list, please also share your email and mention that you would like to be added and I will collect this from the chat. We will be using the same operating agreements as in our prior workshops. Briefly, please remain on mute unless you are speaking. To unmutete yourself over the phone, press six. Please feel free to ask questions in the chat. If you would like to voice your questions or comment, please take a moment now to familiarize yourself with the raise your hand feature. In teams, it should look like the little hand icon. And please be respectful of all participants in the workshop, particularly. With that being said, let's get into today's brief agenda. We have allotted roughly an hour piece for each utility to introduce and discuss their interim solar plus storage rate filings, and they're prepared to walk us through the filings and make themselves available for questions today. We may have a brief break after the first two presenters as desired. We'll see where discussion takes us any remaining time. After the three presenters we may use for additional discussion again as desired, and then we'll follow up with a little next steps and wrap up with that. I think we'll just move right into discussion. Do we have a volunteer to go first? I might even just suggest, I dont know, Dan McNeil or are you willing to go first? Yep. I didn't prepare too much for this, but I'm happy to, to step through some of our calculations in our filing. Do you want tore share something or should I share it? I don't have anything to share of your filings. I suppose I could put up Ro filing. I could go ahead and do that, I guess. Okay, thank you. So can everybody see our filing here on your screens? I can see it, yes. All right, so this is document. It's available on the commission's website. Docket, um, 1000 729. That's where all of our standard avoided cost updates are filed and approved. You know, we just completed our annual update was filed about May 1 and got approved for effective July 1. So this is in addition to that, what we basically, our construct here was the changes to incorporate this new solar and storage rate relative to that annual filing, some pretty modest changes to the standard schedule. There's some descriptions for solar and storage facilities to specify what that is and the different components under the staff's proposal as prov provide the commission what solar and storage means and is and has to be. I'd highlight our standard on peak or peak definition is still heavy load hours, which is a Monday through Saturday excluding Nurk Saturdays 06:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. 16 hours per day. New for the solar and storage is this definition of premium peak, 4 hours per day Monday through Saturday excluding holidays. And those 4 hours change from month to month across the year. We'll get through how that was done in a bit. Every other hour in the day for solar and storage. This premium peak is is only used for solar and storage. This new schedule every other hour in the day, that's not a premium peak, is solar storage off peak. So two prices could apply to a solar and the storage resource. Either the 4 hours at peak to 20 hours off peak, let's see, not else changed in here. You know, the interim solar and storage rate is defined here. And the most interesting part of our tariff is the rates and the new rates for the solar and storage resources. So, you know, this is the premium peak prices, and this is in cents per kilowatt hour. Multiply times ten to get dollars per megawatt hour. But we're proposing monthly specific prices for each month of the year for each of the years. The definition of the premium peak period is 4 hours per day, but sometimes it's split between morning and evening, and it changes in each month of the year. This somewhat tracks like when the sun goes down. So, like in May, the sun is setting slightly later than in April, and so it's a slightly later period. There's a bunch of factors there that impact how the pricing is and when the risks are. And that was all. We'll step through that in a bit. But some morning periods, some evening periods, we made sure that in either the morning or the evening, it's a contiguous set of hours. So up to two periods per day, but not like four random hours spread across the day",

        "text": " requirements for a standard PPA or for standard pricing as set forth in the schedule, then that would be an event of default. We felt that was particularly important here with solar plus storage because we do have really specific eligibility criteria to get these standard prices. Then here is the exhibit. As I mentioned, we have included more detail about the generating facility to make sure that the utility can understand how that is set up and how, and then have added a section about the storage facility. Then the last change was really minors in the exhibits that relate to the MaG. And it's just making clear that solar plus storage is subject to the MAG, which is consistent with the commission order. There are a few footnotes as well where the PPA is making clear which types of resources are subject to which provisions, where we also added reference or clarified the reference to solar PL storage. Any questions? So your I guess just to clarify, the intent would be that this is still because I know in the compliance filings for AR 631 you all filed one PPA that you thought would be applicable for every scenario. And so this would just amend that PPA and so we wouldnt have a separate one that is applicable for solar plus storage and then one for everything else. Yes thats right. Okay thanks Jordan. Zan, are there any provisions of the currently operable standard power purchase agreements from the utilities that would need to change other than the provisions that have been identified here for the new form that you proposed? We haven't done that analysis Ireian because we were working off of this new PPA and I think each utility would have to go back and do that analysis. As you know there are many different iterations of the ppas for the different utilities and different types. So I suspect that within those there could likely be additional changes. But I haven't and I don't think anyone else has done an analysis to figure that out. Okay, that would be a useful thing to know. I don't know what my clients'positions are going to be, but their positions could be that the current form should be used until the commission approves the new forms for the utilities on a permanent basis. Yeah, I think we probably would need to continue the conversation in dock at UM 2299, which I know will have a public meeting relatively soon that might shed some more light on where we're headed with the new form. And if the form that utilities have filed here is used, would the utilities be willing to agree to allow the QF to make changes to those in the event that the commission ultimately adopts on a permanent basis a different PPA form? Are you asking whether the offer from UM 2299 to havert a true up between the interim effect of PPA and the final PPA that's adopted would apply to solar PL storage qfs? Yeah, yeah, I think it would apply to any QF that entered a PPA under the new form in the interim period. Thanks for that clarification. Do we have any remaining questions for the utilities? Yeah, this is Ireia and I wanted to circle back to Pacificore decision to not file a non renewable solar storage rate. There'a lot of things that NIpsec and RAC both believe should be changed and how the standard and renewable avoided cost rate should be set. There'a list of those in UM 2000 and we would ask specific or to go back and think about filing a non renewable standard solar plus storage rate. We don't believe that it's appropriate to prejudge or litigate any of the other issues in UM 2000. Right now we think that paific court should just file the standard avoided cost rate. It has both standard and renewable avoided cost rates and its tariffs. Both of those tariffs are in effect. So of course obligated under those tariffs for any solar facility to allow it to sell power under either renewable or a standard rate. We understand Pacificore'position. You've had it for over five years now. Pacificoreps could have come in and gotten or asked the commission to change the policy and get an adjudicated decision. It is elected not to, which is appreciated that we haven't had to litigate that. But the current commission policy is for there to be both a standard and renewable avoided cost rate. And that's an issue that as long as Pacific Cor continues to have its position, then that'll be addressed in uM 2000 and that's fine. But we don't think it's appropriate for any party to try to change commission policy any way other than what was envisioned with the solar plus storage rate. So our ask would be for Pacificor to go back and rethink that and see if you're willing to file something which has both a standard and a renewable avoid cost rate for solar plus storage and really appreciate Marie, who as usual does a much better review, more careful review of these filings than I do for pointing that out. Sorry about that I was having. Yeah. Audio issues. Yeah. Zach",

        "text": "Good afternoon. Today's May 28, 2024, and you're here for a regular public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. All commissioners are present, and we'll start, as we always do, with a opportunity for public comment on items that are not listed on our agenda for discussion today. I haven't been made aware that anyone wants to make public comment, but happy to have you unmute and introduce yourself if you would like to. Okay. Not hearing any public comment on general public comment today. Let's move to the consent agenda. Good afternoon, chair. This is Commissioner Tanei, and I move we adopt the motions laid out in each item on the consent agenda. Good afternoon, chair. This is Commissioner Perkins. I would second. I concur. The motion carries and the consent agenda is adopted. Right. We have two items on our regular agenda today. The first is an informational only report from Energy Trust of Oregon on its 2023 annual results. I believe we'll have Benedict Springer come on up and kind of set the context for this, and then we'll turn it over to Energy trust board chair Henry Lorenzen and to Mike Colgrove, energy trust executive director. But Benedict, I'll give you the floor to start us off. On behalf of PUC staff. Thank you, chair Decker. Good afternoon, commissioners. Tonyian fruins for their record. My name is Benedictk Springer. I'm a senior energy and utility analyst with the PO, and I'm joined today by Henry Lorenen, board president, and Michael Colgrove, executive director of Energy Trust of Oregon. Before I introduce Henry, let me provide a little context on various energy related activities that have recently come before or will soon be brought before the commission. Today, Energy Trust reports on its 2023 organizational results, including savings and financials, as well as progress towards performance measures, including equity metrics. Staff is pleased that Energy Trust met its goals in complian with 2023 performance measures set by the commission. There are four additional issues I want to mention. First, this March, the commission approved staff recommended changes to performance measures for 2024 in docket number uM 111 58. This is done annually to reflect budget goals and policy considerations. Second, earlier this month in docket number um 1000 893, the commission approved new avoided costs of energy efficiency for use by energy trust in 2025 planning, electric avoed costs increased by 37.6% and gas avo cost increased by 13%. In the next two months, staff is conducting stakeholder workshops to identify additional changes to avoid cost values and methodology, and utilities will submit its next avoid cost data by October 15 for commission approval by the end of the year. Third, since the beginning of the year. Staff and Energy Trust have worked on modernizing the grant agreement between the two entities. The current draft agreement can be seen in, uM, 1158 and staff is accepting public comments until May 30. The commission will review for approval at the public meeting in July or at a public meeting in July 4 Energy Trust is currently working on developing a new strategic plan and framework for multiy year planning. The latter will involve comprehensive planning for five instead of one year increments and will involve a more complex adaptive management framework. While multi year planning is set to start in 2026, this July, energy Trust will shift to developing a budget for 2025 in collaboration with utilities and stakeholders. So these are all activities to look forward for, to and just as a little bit of context on today's meeting. So now that we need to do is Henry Lorenzen, board president, who will make some opening remarks. Good afternoon. Hopefully you can hear me. I see the smile, so I guess you have, you can my name is Henry Lorenzen. I'm president of Energy Trust board of directors. Mike and I are here today, as we have in the past, to present energy Trust 2023 results. And most importantly, I'm here to listen to any comments made by the commission that that needs to be taken back to the full board of directors. And as you will hear, we had a very strong results in 2023 that reflect the tangible ways that were helping customers and communities save energy and also reduce demand upon utility system resources. In my opinion, our work is going to become increasingly important with increasing need for power because the projected development of data centers, including artificial intelligence that is rapidly coming online, the electrification of automobiles, increased manufacturing and the pressures to move from gas to electricity. And with this increasing demand for power and for our gener and distribution transmission resources, the work of energy trust, in my opinion, is going to beoming even more important in the future. And with this I a little bit of a sermon that you allowed me to give. I'll turn this over to Mike. Thank you Henry, and",

        "text": " goal for CBR to be part of the HB 2021 investment portfolio, and we appreciate PGE being responsive with very little time. Staff does not see this target as a blank check like AWIC appears to we see this as a commitment to make an honest effort to make CBR's work and we expect to work closely with parties as PGE makes a pioneering effort in exploring new methods to crack the CBR procurement code in a cost responsible manner. Additionally, parties have sought some clarification on staff's recommendations on different issues and proposed other recommendations. We are generally supportive of them and expect parties we will explain them in more detail today. We believe these include flexibility for PGE to continue issuing other requests for proposals while the long lead time request for information process is underway, requiring PGE to have a chapter in future plans that is transparent about emissions accounting, renewable energy credits and claims. Clarifying that the small scale renewables information requested in the IRPCEP update next year is not a compliance filing, requiring PGE to explain the CBI's of each action item in future plans prioritizing tribal communities and small businesses in PG's work to improve accessibility finally, regarding QF forecasts, we want to clarify that we are recommending that PGE use staff'proposed assumptions in avoided cost filings until the commission adopts an official policy in the Papa docket uM 2000. I would like to conclude by reiterating that the IRP CEP today looks different in many ways since it was initially filed. This evolution is the goal of this public process. Staff strives for the plan to be more earnest than optimistic in projecting what it would take to reach the emissions reduction targets set in HP 2021. That concludes staff's opening statement, and I'm open for questions. Thank you for those really comprehensive, excellent remarks. You've captured not only what staff recommended, but also incorporated sucinctly how staff responds to the other party'key. Arguments commissioner Tanei, do you want to begin with any questions that you have? Staff I would in no particular order. As I was working through filed written comments, I was seeing the CBR RFP with a target number for procurement and then sort of staff commentary around the small scale renewables requirement and concerns about how PGE is sort of on a trajectory to meet small scale renewables requirement and wondering. I wasn't seeing sort of as much a linkage between those as I had sort of assumed implicitly in my head and wondered should I be, am I thinking incorrectly and sort of seeing the two as tightly intertwined or are they really more separate? And some CBR might be ssrs but not all lcvs or ssrs. Can you help me understand how the two do or don'intertwine? They are intertwined. However, I would consider cbres to be a subset of small scale renewables. So not all small scale renewables are community based resources. So PGE's procurement of sort of aiming for a target does, in your mind, help address filling the SSR requirement or where it's an imperfect overlap for the SSR requirement? It could, but I don't think we have that information currently. But this could be something that they could provide in the IRP update, where we are looking for more clarity around how they'going to meet this compliance and whether the CBR could become a part of that. I wanted to offer something into this discussion, and I assume maybe other people will address it if we put it out there. My understanding, which may or may not be correct, is that there's a definition of community based renewable energy in HB 2021 that really asks for a showing how the benefits are accruing to communities in specific ways. The small skill requirement does use the word community based somewhere in the policy statements or something like that, but the requirement is really just be under 20. Me, that's the biggest difference is you could be a small scale renewable resource that might be pretty crummy for a community or might not deliver any of the benefits that the definition in HB 2021 calls out. And to me, that's the tension, I think. I appreciate that. And I sort, I was picking up a similar Venn diagram, for lack of a better word, I guess, when I see AWAC thinking about raising important cost questions about the CBRR, understanding the degree to which they are simultaneously addressing the SSR requirements, or how PGE is thinking about them when they're thinking about their SSR compliance pathway, seems like an important linkage or a place where we need to think carefully about the Venn diagram. Not that that's the only reason you would select a target for ADBR procurement, but the, that is part of what would go into a sort of target for CBR. Am I sort of capturing how we might think about it, how you think about it, Sedsta? Or am I, are you thinking of the staff thinking about it really differently? I think",

        "text": " in a number of ways and I guess just end again, just my concern solely lives. I can eat the property. My children are the biggest concern of mine. I hope you consider that. Hope this is working. Yeah. Okay. My wife and I, Sandy back there. We live on Newland Road, notaway Lane. And we're just a little ways off the Stafford Road interface. We bought our property over 50 years ago, built our own house and one of the considerations was where the big power lines were. Now we know there's a corridor down that crosses Stafford Road from the big PG or the big power plants in eastern Oregon. And we were very much aware of those. I'm also a. I've been involved or my relatives have been involved in building power lines for years and years and years all over the Pacific Northwest, all over the western part of the United States. I have not spoken to them about this situation here. And there's a lot of information that we don't. We don't have. My wife and I don't have. I've heard that the KVA line is 150. And I can tell you from a personal note, the selection of our property was based upon the fact that there was no power lines, big power lines, anywhere near us. And I've been involved with many engineering scenarios. I have multiple degrees in different areas and I'm not in favor of having a big power line going down Staffer road. I will also advise you to take a look at the incident on July 4 of this year where a power line was knocked into and we were without power for 12 hours. And I was told, informed and I have not confirmed it yet, that it was one of the big power lines that was near the Stafford road. So I don't know how you can guarantee any safety. A steel pole doesn't necessarily mean it's not going to get knocked de. That's enough. We're not in favor at all of them. Thank you. My name is Brandnd Huumada and I'm with the Staffford fall upon Valley community climbing organization. And the people in the general community are completely against this project. So, and they're very upset about the idea that you would allow a project like this to occur right down the middle of our community. And. But also, I've submitted previous testimony and I'm not going to go over that. But there is an issue that came out y yesterday where the county says that the TUC is issuing conflicting information about proving condemnation without land useapproval. So we want to get some information on that and we want to know how that process works. Where even though the county denies land use approval, you go ahead and allow condemnation and PGE is able to build the project. So I think that that's just kind of a summary and I've submitted a written testimony. So thank you very much. Thank you. My name is Gary Cowr. I'm not on Stafford Road, but I do live in the community. And as was mentioned, road is design as a scenic road is the route I take when my family goes to and inform a home. Really like to come a little bit about, begin the process. Kind of fair amount of experience working on issues siting energy facility and transmission facilities in front of the energy facility sing campus department, which of course is a much different process. In that process, transparency is important. People's biggest issue is why did you choose this route or why did you choose this location? What I understand, I mean, that information has been really lacking in this process. I know a lot of questions have been asked to why not qu an I five R 205? Yes, both ODOT and us government doesn't allow facilities in their right long in interstate freeway. However, if you look at those properties along it, they're primarily commercial. There's maybe a few houses that would be close to putting up facilities close to the freeway, but generally it's a fairly sparse area. Something that in a much more open transparency process, at least people would have a better understanding as to what routes did PGP look at. Why did they choose those? How robust, what process do they do? Other comment just briefly. Fire is an issue in our community. We don't have hydrants. I think you've heard before, back during the couple years ago when we had fires all over and everybody's concerned, we had some issues in our community to the point where local governments said, we don't have the resources to cover you. So a group of us went together and hired a firm to basically patrol our community, particularly at night, because we also had some threats of some art issues and SM others. But again, it is fire is an issue because the homes I've seen that have been burned in the area, pretty much all this leftu maybe is the shell they just. There just isn't the facilities there to really respond in equipment with that. Thank you for coming. Appreciate it. Okay, thanks for",

        "text": "Good afternoon. Today is April 4, 2023, and this is a special public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. All commissioners are present and we are so pleased to be joined today by representatives of the Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commission or council. I'not sure if I have that right, but you'll let me know. Our guests will introduce themselves and their team and will be providing us with a presentation which is linked on our website. And we'll really look forward to an open and interactive dialogue as we get to know each other here. Please take it away. Okay. Thank you, chair and commissioners. We're happy to be here on behalf of the Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commission and its member tribes, thank you for the invitation. And let's start with a little bit of introduction and, and first, my apologies on behalf of Asia Dakoto, who is our executive director and bounced around this weekend on flights to Connecticut, where she was supposed to make a presentation to some classes at Yale and ended up coming back and falling ill. She's not with us today, but we have a good contingent here to make a presentation. Let me quickly say their names and then ask them to say a little bit about themselves. So first of all, our chair is here, Ron Sepa. Ron is chair of the commission this year. He's also been chair of the Warm spring stribe several times for more than ten years of service. And next, let me introduce Chrisco lightly. And again, we'll ask everybody to say a little bit about themselves. But Chris is in. Works at Critfic'part, of the policy department. It's been my pleasure to work with Chris for more years than she wants me to remember. The Ed sheets has been integral to our efforts to prepare the energy vision. Ed has a long history with energy issues in the northwest. And finally, kind of one of our newer members of this team, but certainly not new to me, is Pat Oshi. Pat. I'll let Pat say a little bit about himself. So maybe Pat, let's just kind of go in reverse order and go let you say a little bit about who you are and then we'll end up with Ron and then we'll go into the presentation. Yeah. Thanks, Rob. Appreciate it. So, chair Decker, commissioners, it's a pleasure to be here. And I, Megan and I had worked together on a number of items over the years when I was a commissioner at the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission. I served two terms and was there for twelve years, from 2001 to the end of 2012. And from there I went to work with WEC as one of their associate general counsels and then led the spin off of peak reliability and its formation and was their general council for the initial period and then moved back to Olympia as they were based down in Portland. That was my most recent work has been with the Power council, and I was the chair of the power committee and working on the most recent power plant issued in 20, 21, 22. Prior to that, I had long history in doing indian law work. Worked with the Aakamaa Nation for a number of years on fish and wildlife issues. I was one of the tribal attorneys at Fort hall and really focused on that until I got bitten by the energy bug back a while. So anyway, thank you. Thank you, Rob, and just appreciate the time with the commission today. Thanks, Pat. Ed got bitten by the energy bug early. Ed, did you say a little bit about yourself? Yes. Well, first, thanks for this opportunity to talk to you. My name is S. Ed Sheetsz. I'm a consultant. I worked on the development of this and previous energy vision. Worked on energy issues since 1975. I worked for Senator Warren Magnusson and represented him in the development passage of the Northwest Power act. Then I was the director of the Washington State Energy Office. Then I was the founding executive director of the Northwest Conservation Power and Conservation Council and have been consulting. I did that for 15 years, consulting since 1996. Several things to focus on. I helped the Yakamaa nation set up Yakima Power, a recent tribal utility. I was one of the consultants that helped establish the Energy Trust of Oregon, which is very close to this commission. And I have been an expert witness in the Bonneville power administration rate case on a couple of occasions, and. Happy to be here. Chris, you want to say a word or two? Hi. Yes, good afternoon. My name is Chris Golightly, and I'm now experiencing some connection issues, but hopefully I can make it through this. I am a policy analyst at Critriick. I worked underneath THRB, and my energy experience primarily centered around just operations of the dams on the Columbia river and their effects on fish.",

        "text": " communities and those without legal representation. This is all. Thank you for your time. Yeah, I appreciate those points. And, and I want to just note that again, we come with some legal complexities in our different processes and what we're trying to do here is make the best use of all of our resources. Again, there are some issues that are well understood and may be able to move to it quick. This decision that we don't want to send significant staff resources on and may not want to you fully engage communities on if they've already been engaged, you know, in raising these issues previously. But I think your suggestion to make sure that people know how to participate in the scoping process is a good one and so that people can represent where they don' I don't think things have been fully explored, I guess, in the writing that we thought so far. Anything further for Marlene? No. Okay, thank you. Let's go to Jack Watson and then Diane Brand. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. There we go. Chairrod Decker, Commissioners Tawy and Thompson. For the record, my name is Jack Watson. I am the director of policy and regulatory affairs for the Orego Organ, Solar and Storage Industries Association. I am glad to see this docket and support the opening of uM 22 73. OA has been actively engaged on HB 221 implementation from the start and has highlighted many of the issues related to compliance. We support GEI's request for a webpage with all the information in one place and NWX requests to hold staff workshops explaining how this docket will move forward for members of EJA communities. Additionally, while the joint utilities comments recommend not including recs in this discussion, we see the REC issue as directly tied to HP 2021 implementation and do not believe it is appropriate to remove from the docket. The scoping process should be kept open in line with the staff report. The conversations from UM 2225 highlight the need to resolve the rec issues from HP 2021 in this docket. Removing discussion of this issue to a separate investigation feels inappropriate at this time. Thank you for your timing. We look forward to resolving some of these difficult issues in the docket. Great, thank you. And like I said to others, you really want to get those scoping and prioritization issues out there quickly so that we know what we can get to and what's ready for us to do our jobs as decision makers and what folks think needs to be either explored more or sequenced to gain more information, whether that's from RPCEP review or from the development of the regional GhD accounting framework that Krishnaani was talking about or otherwise. Okay, let's see. Diane Brand and then Marie Barlow afternoon afteroon good afternoon chair Decker, commissioners Tony and Thompson. My name is Diane Brandant and I'm the or organ director at Renewable northwest. We support staff's recommendation to open an investigation into the HP 2021 implementation issues and to start with a scoping process under the administrative hearing division. Similar to what other commenters have said today, we feel that this separate docket allows this important work and consideration to continue as reflective of the conversation we've had so far in the UM 22 25 docket while while also allowing the progress that has happened in that docket so far not to be held up or to derail any other progress towards the submission of the first IRP ceps coming soon. We appreciate the scoping questions already posed by staff and find that they are reflective of the conversation and appreciate that there is flexibility in having an open scoping conversation from the start and that that could also help determine the format that this would take. As was discussed earlier by staff. We think that allowing flexibility for the format as discussed based on what best suits the scoping that comes from the open process would would be the best way to move forward again. In general, we support staff's work on this important topic and look forward to future support and intervention, potential intervention in this docket and thank you. Appreciate renewable northwest engagement throughout the implementation and look forward to continued constructive involvement going forward. So thank you for your comments today. All right, let's go to Marie Barlow and then Joshua Basipin. Good afternoon. Good afternoon chair Decker, commissioners Tani and Thompson. Marie Barlow with N Sun Energy. I just wanted to comment today that we also support the opening of this docket and don't take any position yet on what process we think is appropriate or, you know, the scope of the issues and understand that'be addressed at theset of this docket. Yeah, just on first glance at the staff report, you know, it seemed like they're thinking creatively about what process might be used and somewhat unconventionally. So I am interested to see where those conversations go in the scoping phase. And I did just want to also express support for GEI's comment about the website today because I was gone from February to May",

        "text": " you guys have. Next slide, please. Okay, so the company's Oregon service area is kind of that chunk highlighted in green in eastern Oregon. It's made up of about 20,000 total customers, about 14,000 of which are residential. And it's almost completely defined as underserved, either rural or frontier. According to HB 2165, the largest towns in the service area are Ontario, Nissa, and Bail, Ontario being about 11,600 people. And the closest urban center to Ontario is Boise, which just 56 miles away, and then the closest urban center in Oregon to Ontario, 260 miles away. So definitely a little bit more spread out and. And rural and nature. Next slide, please. Okay, so kind of going into our first market barrier that we discussed in the Te plan, and that's public charging. So currently, there are two fast charging locations in the service area. There's a Tesla supercharger station in Ontario and an electrify America station in Hunsington, Oregon. And that electrify America station is shown on the right there in that picture. And then the remaining chargers are level one or level two chargers, and those are primarily located in campgrounds and rvs throughout the area. And there is a new charging station that was just unveiled in downtown Vale. And patty will walk through that a little bit more later in the presentation. Next slide, please. Okay, so leading into our next market barrier of driving range. So kind of, as I alluded to in that first slide, the towns in this area are a little bit more spread out, and with that also a little bit further away to some bigger services, like, you know, hospitals, the airport, things like that. So, you know, the closest distance is from Nissa to Boise, which is 51 miles away. So seeing, you know, improvements in battery technology and improvements in driving ranges of EV's coming out, it definitely still is a concern for those that are living in the area. And I have a few quotes here from customers that we received. Not realistic from my location and driving habits, concerns on traveling distances, and can't be driven long distance without recharging. So, you know, while we're seeing improvements in longer range Ev's comes coming out, those do come at higher costs, which sort of leads me into my next market barrier. If you go to the next slide, please. So, the last one that we discuss is price. So I have here listed the median household income of Ontario and Portland, and see that Portland is about 85% higher than that of Ontario. And in addition, according to the 2021 us census, about 20% of people in Malee county, which is where the majority of the population in the service area resides, live in poverty. So we really see price, and we heard from customers in the area as well, being sort of the biggest barrier to adoption in terms of VV's. And I would even note that not just a barrier to, you know, purchasing, but purchasing a new car in general, you know, cost can be a really big barrier for that. So, you know, we are optimistic that with time, you know, there'be a bigger useddb market. But until then, it's definitely a big barrier to entry for customers in the service territory. Okay, next slide, please. Okay, so, sort of jumping into kind of the general awareness and perception of EV's that we're seeing from customers in the service area. In July of 2022, we sent out a survey to our residential customers in Oregon, and we found a few things, and one of them is related to awareness. So you can see in the graph here on the right, we definitely saw improvements from 2019 when we sent out a similar survey, but we're still seeing that a lot of custom in the area are reporting as being not very familiar or not familiar at all with EV's. So it's definitely informed the need to just continue, you know, outreach and education, which Patty will discuss more. And as of the time we filed the te plan, there were 52 EV's in the service area, which represents less than 1% ofbs in Oregon. Okay, next slide, please. Okay, so really getting into the perception of EV's in the area, we asked customers in that survey three questions related to these market barriers that we talked about. And really what we asked is, if this market barrier, market barrier were removed, would you be inclined to purchase the gas or diesel power or, sorry, the EV version of the gas or diesel powered vehicle of your choice? And so, in this instance, you know, if the purchase price is the same for the EV as it was for the gas card vehicle, would you be likely to purchase that? In 64%",

        "text": " think that. And I've reached out to OA and the other trade associations to get their feedback on the, as well. And I haven't, um, I haven't heard back, but I think because it's being used, I'm gonna. If it wasn't being used, I think I was just going to propose deleting it. But since it is being used, I think it's probably worth hearing from the folks that are using it if they want to continue to have that as an option U or, you know, or if they would feel conf, comfortable just, you know, using the new export control section in tier unit through probably tier two. So unless there's you know, Oca or any developers have heard anything back on that, on this call, I think that we'll just leave that open and know that, you know, IREIC is interested in hearing from, you know, from, from those developers what they would, what they would think about that. And uh, now that I've thrown it out there too, would also be interested in hearing from the utilities what they, what they think about that. I don't think I have a specific position at this time and still kind of in the learning, learning phase here. Yeah, we haven't heard back yet, but I've got a call later today with somebody, so I'll let you know what I hear. I think, you know, from PGE's perspective, I think we would need to take it back and discuss a little bit just to noodle on it. And that way we can provide some, some good thoughts. Right. Sounds good. I don't think I need any need to belabor the point then. So the other thing I was thinking of, if we had extra time, was going through the way that export controls were incorporated into the tier four study process within the red lines. So. Stacy, could you pull up those tier four red lines please? So, yeah, so at the top, that was main procedural stuff. Just what to do with a project that gets. That fails the screens or supplemental review. The if. If we're goingna be looking at. I wasn't planning on talking about this today, but I see we have it here. One of the other things that has been in innovation that's worked in many states is getting rid of the feasibility study or making it optional on the part of the applicant. And so we're gonna look at changes to tier four. That's something that Eric would want toa look at. That's been successfully implemented in many states, but wasn't going toa be the focus of what I was talking about today, but'happy to discuss now that we have a half hour left. And if you could go down, please. The next set of edits were the ones that was going to discuss, which are the implementation of export controls. So they. An f. That's just looking at the system impact study. And the goal with these edits was consistent with the batteries project to ensure that any export controls are taken into account when performing the system impacts study. And so that's just to say that the system impact study would, you know, model the export control working as the equipment is designed to operate, and not assume that the project would export its full nameplate rating. And then the last sentence is addressing the fault current contribution. And that's allowing manufacturer test data to be used instead of the nameplate rating if manufacturer test data is provided by the customer. Brian, do you want to add anything about that? No, I don't think there's anything really to add. Just some simple language to make sure that that's noted. Any questions that we slash, probably Brian can answer while we're here together. Hey, Yoki, this is Ted. I'm curious what the utilities think of the waiver of the feasibility study suggestion above. And I'm just asking about that because when we discussed it internally, we thought it might be a little bit outside the scope of what we were doing. Seems fine to me, but I was just curious what the utilities had to say if they had any thoughts. Thanks. So this is Jason, Abb, PGE. I believe the ability to already skip the feasibility study exists within the rules and jump right into a system impact study. We've done that on occasion when, during the scoping call, it looks like a project has minimal or potentially minimal interconnection requirements. We've suggested quite a few times that developers might want to start with a feasibility study. If a project looks to be particularly complicated and has a lot of potential upgrades. So I think within the rules, I think there's already the ability to do it. Ye, Jason, thanks. The way I read the current rules is the utility and applicant will agree to waive the study. And the edit here gives the applicant that ability and doesn't require approval from the utility. Yeah, thanks. Tead. I only brieflyly looked at it before we scrolled down. So I get the nuance there.

        "text": "Good morning, everyone. Today is January 25, 2024, and we're here for a special public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission, where all commissioners are present. And we're here to talk about LC 80, which is Portland General Electrics Integrated Resource Plan and Clean Energy Plan for 2023. Today is the day that we have set for deliberation and decision, as most of you on this meeting. No, we handle these matters through our open public meeting process. And therefore, Commissioner Taney and I have, despite the many months of process here, never had the chance to talk directly about this case. So sometimes it takes us a little while to work through the issues. And so we've set aside as much of today as we need to do that. The second thing that I want to say is because today is set aside for deliberation, and we had extensive opportunities for public comment a week ago. And throughout the process, of course, through written comments and workshops, we won't be taking any public comment today. We may have clarifying questions for staff or the company, possibly others, probably not. And those are to help make sure that we're informed with the facts and our decision and shouldn't be opportunities for advocacy. And I do want to be clear that I won't be calling on anyone who raises their hand wishing to make public comment today. The time for that is passed, and then we need to get on with our decision. In that vein, I want to note that it is not realistic for us to consider written comments that were filed after closed a business yesterday or anytime yesterday, really, or this morning. This is not the way that this process works. And I think that's been clear throughout the course of the proceedings, particularly getting comments from brand new participants. So I just want to be clear that those comments that we received this morning are not part of what we're working with here. I think that covers, well, that covers sort of how we'll work through these things. And what I want to FL ISRT of the order that I anticipate will work through the deliberation. And largely that follows the summary of staff's recommendations in attachment. One of the staff memo speaking about IRP acknowledgement, CEP acknowledgement. Then I think we'll talk about that broadly and then dive into some of the specific PGE action plan items and the related staff recommendation, and then we'll pick up any additional staff recommendations or additional guidance that the commission wants to give. And then finally, we will make our determination of continual progress at the end of the meeting. So I guess I'll stop there as it relates to sort of process for today. Well, one other thing I guess I want to say, just in case anyone hasn't been part of these processes before, as a corollary to the point that I made at the beginning, which is that the commissioners don't have an opportunity to talk about these matters outside of a public meeting. Of course, we hear what each other says in prior workshops and public meetings, but other than that, that's not available. So of course we don't know what our decision will be until this meeting is concluded. Therefore, it will take us some time, especially in these complex, integrated resource plan dockets, to develop a written order. Our decision will be effective when we make it here in the public meeting, but our order memorializing the decision and writing will take a little bit of time following today's meeting. I think that's all I have by way of process introduction. Commissioner Tani, anything that I forgot to say or that you want to say by way of introduction today before we get into the substance. Good morning, chair. Well, I appreciate you laying out a clear path wor today, and there's a lot of content here. And in preparing for today, was really reminded that that IRP was originally filed ten months ago, and we have had such excellent stakeholder engagement, including from a range of new stakeholders, that we've really thoughtght to bring into our processes more effectively over the recent years. And I really want to appreciate the ten months of work by all of those parties. And, you know, I know staff and AHD is always thinking about feedback from those, particularly those newer parties, around how we can continue to make processes more open to them. The energy justice issues that have been raised are really critical, and I appreciate the hard work to get them in the docket in a way that we can grapple with them. So I really see, getting close to this record, I see the way in which it's a richer record with those additional participants and really wanted to appreciate their work doing that and the work everybody has done over ten months to get us to this decision point, which, of course is just the first step in, a lot more step towards actually selecting resources and then getting on to a prudence review. So, looking forward to today recognizing its one way point on a very long",

        "text": " a network. And put that in the division 82 rules. It's really just adding that clarification to the eligibility criteria and then deleting the network screen because it's unnecessary. So it's not a big change, uh, to the rules. Okay, I got it. So tier, tier one projects probably would be appropriate, not, you know, you can't qualify for a tier one if you're on a network to, like, no one's putting little QF downtown without a study is all always saying, I. My understanding, I think we talked about this at one of the past workshops, but someone feel free to jump in from the utilities to clarify. But my understanding is there's been very, very few tier one projects in general. And I don't know if any have ever tried to interconnect to a network, but I would assume that's rare. Okay. I'm not trying to bully bir. This makes sense to me. Thank you. Sure. Hey Jordan. Good morningy. Yeah, thank you. So I would agree that projects on network systems need to be studied to ensure safety and reliability. So for this reason, the tier one rule and indeed many other states do not discriminate against interconnection on t I think you might have cut out myat use. Can folks hear me? Am I having connection? I think has a limit for the Dr. S on networks. So the tier one room already has. Sorry, we missed a bunch of what you're saying. Midhots's in Kenya right now. I think the action isn't that great, but ye, you started to sound better therete. But I think I'll try and paraphrase and let me know if I missed something. But in general, you know most states do allow level ones to go through the screening for area networks. They're small in size and could actually pass the screens. So I don't know what else midhut wanted to say beyond that, but I don't think we see any reason to not allow them to be screened for connection to networks on the or anyone. Are there risks that the screens don't capture that occur when you're connecting to a network? And what are those? I think the main point is once you start feeding back power into the network across the point of common coupling, you know so if you ever exceed the, if the generation at one point would ever exceed the load of the customer, then they could feed back into the network. And if fed back enough such that the load available on the network wasn't great enough to absorb that back feed, then that generation could back feed through the network protector and that could trip off the entire circuit, which it's not. It can actually be reconfigured so that that doesnt happen. But that would take work to do and probably study to determine whether thats going to happen or not so that the idea is just to keep the generation so extremely small that thats not a possibility. Thank you for that clarity. I dont know if anyone has a different perspective, but I also don't know if this is what Jord wanted to focus on. So I I can save it. No, I mean, I think I wanted to or we wanted to explain our thinking and hear and discuss others views, so. But of course I've quickly gotten out of my level of expertise. So I see Jeff Davis, as the Amda. Bail me up. Yeah, I just wanted a quick comment here. So the current tier one and tier two rules for small generators are allowing spot network interconnections, but they don't allow area network interconnections. These are two different types of networks here. Area networks being more complicated. And so if you were to go the small generator route, you'd have to go. And you had an area network interconnection, you'd have to go tier three or four versus net metering, you could be a spot network or an area network and go level two. So either way, area networks don't go kind of the first level or tier of the current set of rules. And I presume that's not because they're very small. That would be counterintuitive, but because they have the lightest screening rigor. So area networks are more complicated than spot networks. So I'd say they're more rigorous to, I don't know, determine if it's safe to interconnect. Right. Yeah. Can I confirm? You said that area networks can. You can be eligible for tier two, but you can't be eligiblery. Not tier two for level two. So metering. Net metering has both spot and area networks at level two. But for the small generator, tier one and two, it's only spot. Got it. Okay. And are the. Okay. Thank you. And maybe just for a quick high level difference. So, like, a spot network is serving loads that are right there, close to the network protectors. You typically. You have multiple network protectors serving one spot network, so they're in parallel. And then an area network",

        "text": "Good morning, everyone. Today is September 22, 2023. And we're here for a special public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. We are in the brave new world where we have two commissioners present for the time being. And we are welcoming today a discussion of Portland General Electric Company's 2023 Integrated Resource Plan and Clean Energy Plan. To remind everyone, although I'm sure everyone is tracking this. We held last Thursday another special public meeting in this docket in which we explored with stakeholders and staff their written comments evaluating PGE's plans. And today is our opportunity to focus in with PGE on their quite extensive response to those quite extensive comments. I've been using the phrase never a dull moment really frequently in my life right now. And this meeting certainly will qualify. The way that we'll handle today is pretty simply. We'll ask PGE to provide a brief summary of their reply comments. Sort of however they see fit, given all that was in those comments. And then I think what we'll do is kind of travel through those comments, big picture, sort of section by section, and let myself and Commissionerer Tanei ask PGE some questions and seek some clarification. We likely won't get through every issue that was raised or that PGE included in its reply comments since so many issues were raised around these plans. But we will do our best to get to as much as possible. We are still tracking all the other issues, certainly, that are coming up in written comments. And we'll find a way to get to all of them in our decision. We just, for everyone's understanding, our trying shooting to conclude sometime in the 1130 range. So I think that'll give us a good amount of focus time with PGE again. Recognizing that we won't get to everything. Commissioner Tani. Unless I've left something off. Or if you want to say anything by way of introduction. I'll just go ahead and bitite PGE's team up to give that quote, unquote, brief summary of their reply comments. And in whatever level of detail you think is appropriate here. Good morning. Good morning. Chair Decker and commissioner Tani. Okay to get started. All right. So, again, we appreciate the opportunity here to address our reply comments. As well as just the very thorough and thoughtful comments that have been rendered to pg throughout this process. So we look forward to addressing any comments or concerns you might have about the reply comments that we recently submitted. I'm just going to highlight a few key points from our reply comments. As you mentioned, they were quite extensive and we're happy to dig in. Ono the details of of anything that I don't touch upon. Now here at a very high level, I'm joined by Seth Wiggins, our IRP manager, as well as some of our subject matter experts who may join in depending the discussion, depending upon the direction it goes. So I'll start with just addressing some of the comments that came in around IRP modeling. We heard from several parties about modeling concerns, and we don't think this is a surprise, sort of, given that the guidelines for this IRP and this clean energy plan were very new and they were finalized with little lead time for us to incorporate significant modeling innovations by the timeline for our IRP CEP filing. We've really appreciated the conversations at the time that recognized the importance of getting started, given the nearness of the 2030 target and of not letting perfect be the enemy, the good and importantly of learning by doing and evolving our processes to include the feedback we'd received from you commissioners, from staff, and from stakeholders through processes and conversations like this. Throughout this process, we've been very direct and transparent about what we perceive to be limitations in our current set of analytical tools. For example, in our March roundtable, throughout all of our filed comments, we've addressed this and the May 2 special public meeting as well. The improvements that we prioritize throughout this process have been aimed at better estimating system requirements and understanding the trade offs that exist between affordability, reliability and decarbonization. In order to identify what we perceive to be the best path forward for our customers of achieving the emissions targets, we interpret staff's main concerns be focused on the viability of our preferred portfolio to meet emissions targets. Obviously, this is an important question, but we strongly disagree with some of the assumptions used and some of the conclusions from staff analysis, and we're happy to go into greater detail about it. But I guess what I'll note now is just that our modeling, as you're aware, already demonstrates a very significant resource need of more than 3000 mw by 2030, and that's based on our current emissions modeling capabilities. While we certainly look forward and are committed to evolving our modeling capacities in the future to capture more granularity, particularly around hourly emissions reporting and operations, our modeling at this point is sufficiently robust to clarify and quantify what we believe to be the obvious next",

You might want to check your microphone and make sure it's working properly. Okay, I will later. Oh o, we can hear you now. Okay. Oh, good okay, well, now we can. I don't know if you're speaking. It worked for just a minute. We could hear you, but I cannot hear you now. All right, Heidi. Well, I can't hear you. So what I propose we'll do is maybe I'll come back to you in a few minutes and see if we've got things working. Hello. Hello. Now we can hear you. Yep. Crazy. Okay, first of all, thankh. Than away. Are we good? Now I can hear you again. It's sort of coming in and out. I don't know why. I'll try to make it brief. Thank you for these presentations. I'm part of a small local advocacy group in the Oak Creek Valley in Oregon, and I just want to make the observation that a lot of the PUC's work is rightfully focused on rate setting. One of the concerns we have has to do with infrastructure safety. And so I just want to. I could say more, but I just want to throw that out there in case it's something that is touched on later in the presentation. Yeah, I do have a little bit on that and I really appreciate that. And it's a really important area for us. We have a tremendous amount of new wildfire responsibilities, for example. That's a big part of what we do now. And we have a whole safety division. So I will talk about that safety division a little bit. But Heidi Caswell is the director of our safety division. She's very accessible, always welcomes comment and discussion with folks. I would encourage you to engage with her if this is an area that your group will be interested in, she'll be welcoming of that. And we'll help you navigate some of our safety dockets and other issues that she's working on. Outstanding. Finding her contact information. Yeah. Before we finish up, I will make sure I post it in the presentation in the chat per. But it is accessible. She is findable on the website. I'm not exactly sure how because I always find her internally, but I will post that information. Thank you so much. Sure. Thank you. All right, well, the hands work and we'll move on to the next part of the presentation. Okay, so we're going to talk a bit about how we make decisions at the PC. The various ways'got. Three core ways we make decisions, and we're going to go through those. And I do mention rate cases a lot in this presentation, but I do that mostly for the purpose of explaining how a contested case works, which is one of the types of ways we make decisions. All right, so we're going to start with contested cases. And contested cases are those cases where the commissioners essentially act as judges. They're weighing evidence and applying legal standards, and they're going to issue a written decision like an appeals court would orial a civil trial court. This is our most formal process, and it's very important before you as an advocate, try to engage in a case or a docket that you understand what type of docket you're engaging in. I want to assure everyone there are no dumb questions about this. In terms of engaging in a case, you can. If you decided to get involved in a matter, please let us know at the filing center. If you have questions, let the staff know. The staff is listed for each docket online and they're accessible. Make sure you clarify what type of case it is, because that will really help you determine how you're going to participate. We'll talk about a bit about contested cases. These are trial like cases in which we have disputed issues of fact and law and sometimes policy. But essentially what we need to do is we need to make some factual findings, and then we need to apply some legal standards to take action. In these cases, we work through the Administrative Procedures act, least portions of it. Then we have a series of administrative rules in division one that are applied as well. These are cases that typically involve the rights and privileges of parties. What does that mean in English? Well, it means that something pretty serious is at stake for a person, and in this case, a person can be a utility. It means due process needs to be engaged. When we think of due process, we think of fundamental individual rights, property, and that's really where we get into the most issues here at the",

        "text": " IRP to the 2021 IRP, I could look up those costs. We have those listed, or appendix C for each of those two irps. If you'd like me to look up those costs, I can do that that really fast. But I would say in general, we saw cost declines, I think fairly substantial cost declines for solar resources between the 2019 IRP and the 2021 IRP, as well as for battery storage and for wind. And so we did see a lot, very, very large cost drop off, I believe, between those two irps. And still BQH ended up being part of the portfolio. Yes. Let me think. Every time. It's been hard for me to get information about the class course that way. The other questions that I would have is, just in terms of considering options, how significant is weedling? I've asked or tried to get figures on how much of this transmission line is intended to be used for just transporting energy out back and forth, and how much of it is actually going to be used for distribution of energy for Idaho power or Pacific core customers. And those figures seem to be really elusive. Can you answer that or respond to how much of this transmission line is really intended for local customer base? Yeah, generally, if you think about it in terms of peak load service, we would expect that r 40, we have 45% of the project, and so 21% of the project would be used to serve Idaho powers customers. And that represents about 500 mw in the summer, 200 mw in the winter was that split, and then the other 24% of our 45% would be used to serve Boill Bonneville Power administration'customers, and that represented 550 mw in the winter and 250 mw in the summer. That is only speaking specifically to peak load service. And so that's kind of how we've been allocating those megawatts of capacity. But the amount of time we spend at peak is very low comparative to the rest of the year. And so our expectation was that that transmission would be made available to ourselves or to others. And, you know, reduce costs for all customers. All of the wheeling costs are modeled and put into our financial models as a cost offset to the overall cost of the project. We aren't forecasting any increased wheeling beyond the Bonneville Power administration's wheeling, but we do expect that there likely will be. And so that would result in reduce costs as well. But yeah, that's the general split between how we expect to use those megawatts from a peak basis. Peak capacity basis has the capacity that has to be reserved for, for instance, wind energy has that capacity with, I guess, of the reserve capacity. Has that become narrower as newer wind and solar are being developed and the amount of energy going on to the transmission infrastructure, I'm assuming from everything I read, should be more consistent because of things like battery power. Yeah, I'm not sure I follow your question. Do you have a referenceilbert to point me to on that one? Okay. What I'm referring to is fert passed some rules that basically say for new wind and solar, they have to guarantee, basically guarantee a certain amount of energy. They can't be all over the board as far as the amount of energy that's going on to transmission infrastructure. And I believe that's like 1000, but the number of the rule. And so I'm trying to figure out whether or not the reserve capacity on these transmission lines continues to be the same bad bandwidth as it's when wind energy and solar energy. We're having these radical swings between virtually non energy and. And lots of energy. So I would think it would get less the need. I am not familiar with the order that you're referring to, and I don't believe that. I believe there might be a misunderstanding there regarding that order. Wind will do what wind does and solar will do what solar does. That's part of the reason for expanding the transmission system is that we need to be able to move variable energy resources around when the wind is blowing in one place, but maybe not blowing in the other place. And so I'm not aware of a FERC requirement to curtail wind or curtail solar to have them be, you know, more flat profile or more dispatchable. So there may be a misunderstanding there, or maybe I'm miss not understanding the question. It wasn't about curtailing them. It was about having other resources like battery power or a combination of wind power and solar to just help stabilize the flow of energy onto the transmission lives because of the difficulty in assuming a whole lot of variable energy onto the infrastructure. That was the reference that I was curious about, but it doesn't sound like that is that's going actually impacting the amount of transmission reserve capacity that's being recorded right now. I'm not aware of what you're referring to, so I don't know",

        "text": "'s proposal and the pilots that PAC developed, which is that at the time of the filing, PGE had proposed to continue to move forward on those pilots and develop them further. And PacifiCorps had not reached a total, at the time of the filing with the plan, had not reached a point of decision. And so they noted for their next steps. Further exploration of it was two parts, depending on the pilots, one of which was not, let's see, which was the storage and solar pilot. And that was cost effective from the utility perspective, but had very high costs for participants in as much as investing in solar and storage systems. The other pilot was targeted energy efficiency deployment, and that was cost effective. There was some uncertainty which required further follow up to see if it could be deployed in time to meet the need of the grid. And so at the time of the filing, those were not resolved as go or no go. And so I think following up on that to learn what's not necessarily today, perhaps the company wants to address that or not. But in the future, to follow up, if they've resolved and have any defined routes going forward, I think is an important question. Should they move forward, it will require some additional thinking regarding regulatory mechanisms, deferral accounting, for example, whatever the case might be, to figure out how to move those forward within our current structure. Okay, thank you. Appreciate the complex complexity of the question. And I thought that was a nuanced answer, which is what I expected to. So, Commissioner Thompson, it seemed like you were about to ask a question. Yeah. Thanks, chair, and thanks, Nick. This question is also, I think, in large part of the invitation for the companies to maybe comment on their views on this topic. But when I think about the DSP, it's obviously a new process. And look at the reports, and they're, you know, re, they're really detailed. And I know that these kinds of reports don't just create themselves, that they represent a lot of staff time. And so, you know, for me, the regulatory burden that's created by a new program like this is certain and obvious. And we all hope, obviously, that, that that burden is outweighed greatly by the benefits that come from the process and that we're achieving the goals. And so a couple of the goals that I wanted you to comment on just a little bit that are in my mind, one obviously is a greater engagement with the public when it comes to distribution system planning, and installation of infrastructure. That obviously affects people that live near the infrastructure and obviously, you know, can impact rates. And so we hope for a greater community engagement. And then, you know, I also think one of the main goals is hopefully that the utilities get greater efficiencies in their planning processes, that they see opportunities that maybe weren't apparent to them, you know, before they undertook this planning exercise. And obviously there's a lot of other goals that are served and desired out of this process. But those two were in my mind. And as I look at the plans, I see some pretty good evidence of community engagement and insights from customers about how they understand the electric system, how it affects their life, what their values are with respect to it. And then I think you've also covered a couple of instances where the utilities seem to maybe have gotten new insights into their own system through the analyses that they do to put these plans together. Is that a pretty good assessment? Is there anything else that you'd add to that in respons to the question being like, are we achieving at least those two goals? Do you see evidence of that? And let me just restate the two goals. Commissioner Thompson so dialed in community engagement specifically and sorry to have to ask, the second goal was what? Yeah, I would say, you know, efficiencies or new insights into the utility system. So basically, you know, utilities seeing new opportunities that are beneficial for this and for their customers. Thanks. Sorry to have the blank there. Good question. Commissioner Thompson, I do think you are re right on track with respect to community engagement. I do think there's good evidence of that. And I welcome, as you noted, the company to address further if they'd like, the value of doing that, the efficiency and the processes is a little bit more, I think midstream with respect to pacific power because of this sort of approach they took in which they developed these new techniques and then have implemented them in part in the transitional study areas. Those were successful in those two areas, at the risk of speaking for the company, but the plan characterizes them as, you know, the results is kind of delivering the results of the processes were as expected. And so, so that's a positive development. How they roll that out across different terrain, different service territories, different kinds of customer clusters",

        "text": " who aren't involved in those contested cases, sort of a real disconnect between the plans and what they say the company should do based on long term analysis and what the company is actually doing that without some explanation is pretty hard to understand. I don't know that. Again, I think it's difficult, important but difficult to have you explaining this in this environment because isn't we're having to think through what the relevance to these kinds of planning environments is of the kinds of financial considerations that you're talking about. But the whole thing doesn't make sense unless we hear from you on that. So I appreciate you saying something and I think my question when you take at face value what you're saying, which is that there's a sort of an extreme prioritization of funds out the door happening right now and a focus on finding maybe less capital intensive ways to solve most solve for the most important things the company needs to deliver. It goes back to the planning environment and sort of like how are we translating from this? So it ends up being more a question for Rick, unfortunately, than for you, is sort of like how are we translating from this best case scenario, what we would do if we had no constraints over a 20 year period to these are our reliability needs and we're going out to get these outside of RFP, outside of resource plan. I guess it's that translation and it kind of relates back to my questions earlier about how are you delivering the explanation of what your near term reliability needs are as you do that prioritization. Rick, can you help me with, with that question? Maybe I can try know where is how would you explain how you're making decisions about what your actually procuring as opposed to what your plan says you would be procuring. Yeah. And I will say that, you know, when our knowledge and our thinking about this has evolved considerably from last fall to where we sit today as well. Right. It's not been a static voyage as we've gone down this road. When we're considering those elements that Nikki just talked us all through, I would say big picture. We understood pretty early that it was something we needed to be aware of and wrap our heads around the prioritization sort of areas without, very most importantly, without losing sight that we have an obligation to reliably serve our customers in light of those constraints. And so the dialogue, frankly, that I've been involved with now for months has been, well, what is the best, best bang for a buck, so to speak? Right. What are the things that we can pursue that, you know, are not likely to, you know, make Nicki Niki's world more difficult, all of our worlds more difficult, and still hit that reliability target. It would not have been in my. I'm strongly believe this in our best interest or our customer'best interest to plow ahead with that last RFP and sign up thousands and thousands of megawatts of wind solar battery contracts the way that we originally set out, particularly in light of what we've learned as it relates to that wildfire risk and reliability topic. But. And also our instincts, I think we're right in that the best bang for our buck is to shore up cap. You know, I mentioned these extreme weather events. We. I've seen firsthand that we are most pinched in those net needle peak hours. So call it hour ending 17 to 22 on a 24 hours basis. In those summer months when we hit those white knuckle periods in the past, those have been the hours where we were the most nervous and we were likely to hit shortfalls. And so it just made logical sense that let's get what we can get on a battery basis. Cause that's exactly what that resource can help build and shore up from a reliability standpoint, is that time period. We already had plans to pursue incremental battery projects even out of the last IRP. So that's nothing new. It's just prioritizing in that area. And the reason I mentioned 26 and our focus there is that's frankly just the soonest that we could get, you know, contracting done, long lead equipment from the developers. You know, they get that equipment ordered and construction actually completed is in that window. And that's what we set down to prioritize. And now that we were getting close to making actual decisions. As noted by we're in advanced contract negotiations for a portion of this. You know, we're now able to kind of account for this in our analysis. And you know, it turned out that our instinct ended up lining up with what we are seeing in the IRP update, which also says, hey, you need some capacity on your system, you're going to need capacity on your system regardless of what we're seeing in every case we're looking at. And now's the time to go pull the trigger on some of these battery projects to shore up that reliability message here in the near term. So you are taking, what I hear you saying is you are taking",

        "text": "ani. I just want Toa check to make sure my audio and videos coming in okay. I've been having some technology challenges today, as per the theme of the week. You're loud and clear. Okay, wonderful. Thank you. For the record, I'm Kristen Sheeran, senior director, planning and sustainability and policy, joined by Seth Wiggins, our IRP and CEP manager. I want to start us off by recognizing, as others already have, the significance of this milestone and the many people who have worked incredibly hard to get here. I'll start with the legislators, community organizations, advocates, utilities, and other energy suppliers who collaborated to pass House Bill 2021 to the commission staff who work diligently and quickly to establish and implement CEP guidelines to the DEQ team for facilitating emissions accounting, and importantly, all of the stakeholders and community members who participated in LC 80, our roundtables, our learning labs. On behalf of PG, I want Toa say thank you. And while there have been a few hard conversations throughout the process, there's always been mutual recognition that we're working toward the same goal, a safe, reliable, and equitable path to decarbonizing Oregon's electricity supply that's centered on our customers needs and and consistent with Oregon's climate goals. To chart that path, PG overhauled its modeling for long term resource planning, including how we do forecasted emissions, cost, and transmission resources. Throughout the process, we engaged with our customers, our communities, and other stakeholders to inform our efforts and to create greater transparency. Our IRP and CEP modeling reflects our current capabilities, which we're committed to rapidly evolving, and what we learned from communities and stakeholders, as well as what we know to be true today about technology, resource availability, and cost during a period of highly dynamic change in our sector. PGE CEP represents the first time an Oregon utility has detailed a course to meeting House Bill 2021 requirements, and it marks this utility's commitment toward planning for and actualizing those targeted reductions to the actions identified in our action plan. Over the course of the last year and a half, we detailed a path to continuous progress to the 2030 target that balances cost, system reliability, and emissions reduction based on resources that are technically feasible and commercially available today. Further, we modeled our systems longer term energy and capacity needs and the types of technologies and resources that will be needed on the path toward deeper decarbonization targets that come in in 2035 and 2040. Though we wish we had the crystal ball to predict which technologies at which price points will become available to our customers and when. Our modeling is very robust based on data and industry best practice today. And we looked to history also to remind us that markets and innovation positively responds to strong public policy signals. It wasn't all that long ago that policymakers and stakeholders and utilities were debating the the feasibility of Oregon's initial RP's standard, which now seems easy in comparison. As we prepare to take the next steps identified in the action plan, we remain committed to learning by doing meaningful and continuous community and stakeholder engagement and rapid evolution of our modeling and forecasting capabilities. We recognize that in some cases, simplifying assumptions based on data availability and modeling capabilities may not have shed full light on all of the nuances P PGE may confront as it replaces fossil fuels with non emitting alternatives. Decarbonization is fundamentally changing every aspect of how we do business and how we serve our customers. And at the same time, and I think, as was noted in the opening comments by the chair and Commissioner Tanei, our industry is also rapidly changing. From the introduction of the Western Resource Adequacy program, to the expansion of organized markets, to the complicated patchwork of state greenhouse gas policies, to advances in energy technologies, rapid electrification, changing customer preferences, unprecedented large load growth, changes in power flows, and regional transmission constraints, just about everything about our business is changing. Furthermore, there are always variables beyond the utility's ability control that may make it challenging to integrate clean resources, including resource availability and cost, macroeconomic factors, and the increasing weather variability wrought by climate change. But with all of that said, we are confident that our analysis is robust and adequately accounts for these dynamics. Given what we know today, we have identified a path to the 2030 emissions target that balances cost, reliability, and emissions reduction and is consistent with the requirements of House Bill 2021 and the CEP guidelines. But we also expect we will know more, and we will know differently in time, and that new information and learning will be captured in future irps and ceps as we iterate a path to the emissions targets. Most importantly, in our view, we have identified the next right, no regret steps to decarbonize our system. Consistent with House Bill 2021 and CEP guidelines, we've identified a very significant resource need, and realistically",

        "text": " of take on the issue. I think the other utilities may have concerns. So that's where some flexibility, probably important. Thanks, both of you. Anybody from Pacific Corps, Idaho Power, have any thoughts on this. Hi, Ted. This is Mark Patterson with Idaho Power Company. Oh, yeah, thanks, Mark. So, in March of 21, we started rating systems about their ac size. So any system that's gone in since or applied since March 21 is on the AC side, so. But we don't have the legacy systems before that are still on the DC side. And in some cases, we don't have good inverter information. We weren't collecting that at the beginning. So we don't have a lot of systems in Oregon. So I'm not sure how long that would take for us to go back and track that down. That's kind of where we're at. Hey, Ted, this is Matt Lous with Pacificoreps. I know Lee is out this week on vacation. He would be the person that could respond best to that. But I think kind of what Eric was talking about in terms of providing flexibility, I think would be key for us. I don't think we're as far along as PGE. That's my understanding. But again, unfortunately, Lee was not able to. Big call today. Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. Yes, yoki, thanks. So, yeah, I just want to express appreciation for everyone that's done, you know, work on, you know, figuring this out. I know that data management is a difficult issue. And, yeah, I worked with NRel and wrote a whole paper on data validation associated with hosting capacity and interconnection studies. And that just underscored that it's, like, really important to get it right. And, yeah. So, yeah, first off, just wanted to express appreciation for all the work that's been done so far. Second thing is, I think one thing that we heard from energy trust in, you know, some of the conversations was that it would be important that data sharing be reciprocal. So I think that when we're looking at this, it would be good to have the commission endorse reciprocal data sharing about Ders so that it's not only that the energy trust is providing information so that the utilities version of power clerk is more complete, but that, you know, the utilities are also providing information to energy trust so that energy trust'version of power clerk could be more complete as well. And I think that would serve important public policy goals for the state of Oregon in keeping the independent administrator of many Der programs having accurate information about projects in the state. And then the last thing I would say is, I appreciate that it will take time. And in my experience, there is no greater motivator for getting things done than a deadline. I'm a procrastinator myself. Um, and u you know, a deadline helps get things done. So I would support setting a reasonable deadline to get this done. Thank you. Appreciate that. On deadlines. I don't know, and I'll just throw it out there just in case. But do any of the utilities have a thought on if we did establish a deadline? I'm assuming 30 days wouldn't be long enough. Six months, a year. Is there something there that sounds reasonable? I'll just. Just. You know, and I know you haven't had a chance, necessarily to get into all the details, but just looking for a guesstimate. So trying to think of a timeline that's relevant. You mean six months from the end of the formal rulemaking? That seems reasonable for PGE, but I want. I feel like I probably shouldn't speak for Pacific Corps, but you need to keep in mind that they're in the middle of an it transformation and this is a massive it lift on their legacy system that will just go to waste. Having built. Been the one who built the current system and knowing it's going away, it is an unintended consequence to potentially to make them update that legacy system before their new systems are in order. So now I'll stop speaking for them. But since they're not on the subject matter experts are on. You may want to hold that discussion until somebody with some knowledge on their it upgrade situation can provide some feedback. Yeah, I appreciate that, Eric. Again, Ted, sorry, this is Matt Lopis. But maybe in response to your question, Ted, about, you know, best estimates or something from the utilities, maybe that's something, at least for Pacific Cor standpoint. We could get back to you or to this entire group in writing, like in maybe early next week, if that would be okay. Sure. That works fine. And I know it's just throwing it out there, so. No problem if you don't have the answer right off. Okay. Any additional comments, questions on handbooks or the data? Yeah, one question. One more question. Ted",

We're back for regular agenda item number five on today's regular public meeting'welcome. Ted Drennin to introduce the work that he and a solid group of stakeholders have been doing on the Oregon PUCc's interconnection rules. Good afternoon, Ted, and welcome to the meeting. Thank you. And good afternoon, Chair Decker, Commissioners Tany and Thompson. For the record, I'm Ted Drennen with OPUC staff. I'm joined today by my colleagues, Caroline Moore and staff council Stephanie Andrews. Today I'm here to ask the commission to approve staff request to open a formal rulemaking and issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to adopt changes into division 82 small gener interconnection rules and division 39 net metering rules. Our current interconnection policies for net metering projects and small generators are going to turn 20 soon. These rule changes represent the first set of rule changes in a longer process to modernize these rules. Given the many public policy goals in front of us, we think that updating the rules to take advantage of modern technologies and other advancements is one of the foundational tools to facilitate easier, more cost effective interconnections, especially for more flexible and high value emissions free resources like those including storage. In the interest of time, I won't go through all of the background in process, rather highlight some of the changes and some of the decisions that will need to be made in next steps in the process. First off, I want to thank all the stakeholders for participating in the process. To date, there were many parties representing many different interests. Participants included Idaho Power, Pacific Corps, PGE, Creria, REc, OSEA, IreEc, and Energy Trust, as well as input from external experts including both EPRi and Nayruk. I want to thank all of the parties for their involvement and willingness to look for solutions to the issues we addressed. There was a lot of give and take to achieve the consensus or non opposition on the majority of the proposal that we're presenting. A special thanks to IREEC as well for the proposal relied heavily on their model rules and their batteries toolkit. These were used as starting points for the working groups to identify changes that would improve and streamline our current policies for interconnection. Excuse me, some highlights of our proposal includes a switch from focusing on the generating equipment size to focusing on the actual amount of that projects are going to put on the grid, as well as updating IEEE standards, which are needed to safely and effectively capture the benefits from modern inverters and other advancements. The combinations of these, along with the updated screening practices, should address concerns related to ensuring readiness for the types of projects being promoted by state policy, including community solar resiliency and flexible decarbonization. Staff is happy to discuss the consensus positions that the commissions would like to do, if the commission would like to do so. But again, in the interest of time, we'll highlight the areas of contention first, the areas that have key decisions remaining. If you can turn to the next slide, you'll see a list of these issues. Now we're pleased. Staff is pleased that the parties were able to get to this point where there is only r1 disputed technical engineering issue. The area of disagreement involves the requirements for additional protective gear on circuits using high speed reclosing. The joint utilities believe this is necessary, while IRE REC disagrees due to the capabilities of modern inverters. Another complexity that the new screening policies create is how our new approach to the size threshold that allows you to pass the tier one fast track screens should be applied to the net metering customers, residential net metering customers who are capped at 25 kw in generating nameplace size. As part of the interconnection modernization, there will need to be updates to utility interconnection handbooks, a generic term that covers actual handbooks as well as requirements in other company documents such as tariffs. The process for incorporating uM 20 111 changes and future updates is up for discussion with parties differing on the",

        "text": " But I think they should be considered as one of the many lenses that the projects are evaluated on. I'll pause for a minute. Does that make sense? Any follow up questions for valerie there? Sure, I'll ask a follow up question. I appreciate your engagement. I guess when it comes to the cod, for example, PGE indicated, okay, we'll loosen that a little bit and we'll give people a little bit. But we're still going to prioritize projects that are in the nearer term. Yeah. Is that for kind of what you're describing there? So, for example, I don't know what that looks like topic. But if PGE said, you know, you have to have been through the BPA 2022 TSEP process. But, you know, can still. You can still meet the minimum bid requirements. But we'll prioritize those that have. Is that actually a helpful constructs for us to consider or do you think that it still feels so subjective that maybe it just leads to too much confusion? No, I think that's really a helpful construct. Like, I think it's a very helpful construct to say that other projects will be considered if they don't meet the rigid requirements, if they bring high value, or if they have a clear path to meeting these requirements in a certain amount of time. I think you mentioned at the end that there wasn't really a bright line around PG's exact procurement preferences on some assets and they kind of have to look at things uniquely. I would say that that concept should apply to some of the minimum b requirements too. Like, for instance, permitting is supposed to all be done by short listing, you know. So I hope I answered your question. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Appreciate it. Great. Thank you so much for the perspective. Is there anything else that you wanted to comment on this topic? No, and sorry. I do think it's really, really good. Right. Because the cods get pushed the further you wait to wrap up. Appreciate the perspective. I guess maybe my other question is just, I'm understanding that the minimum bidder requirements that you're concerned about are the ones that relate to kind the distance that the project has traveled thus far. I mean, are there any other minimum bidder requirements that you're concerned about? I mean, recognizing that'sort of an abstract category, but I'm sort of hearing you say you look at. You should cast a wide or not by looking at in an earlier stage, sometimes other bitter requirements that are problematic. But I'm not hearing you raise those. Yeah, I mean, I really. Yeah. Permitting and transmission, like transmission just been discussed so much that I didn't bring it up again. But they're both, like you said, they're both kind of stepping towards, as you take these big steps towards shovel ready, you make a lot bigger investments. Right. You put a lot more money at risk, and. Which is fine. And I think if you have a great asset, in some ways, you should be willing to do that. But when you're beholden, if you do it really for one buyer in the Packr northwest, you are beholden to that buyer. That's what's unique and difficult about this market from a developer's perspective. So I'm telling PGE, I hope that you're. Yeah, I hope that you encourage, not discourage developers to think uniquely about your needs when we go to develop assets. Don't make it so hard so I'm happy to hear that there's, like, this other. This other RFI coming and other opportunities in the future. But that uncertainty isn't good either. Right. So that, like, uncertain timeline, and we'll go back out again. And so these RFPs are, you know, we all speak for all developers going to put so much of our, you know, time into these, so. Got it. Wonderful. Thank you. Okay, let's go next to Jake Stevens and then Arn Sanger, and then we'll let Jacob close us out. Yeah. Thank you, chair docTr commissioners Jake Stevens with NAn Energy. And I want to comment a little bit on just some of the transmission assumptions approach relative to this. But also, I really think you're focused in on the right issue here and where this is going. And I think Commissioner Tani started to zero in on it is, functionally, we don't have scoring to reflect these other attributes. So we have abalance of issues that you guys are. I feel like I hear you wrestling with to try to draw out, well, timeline versus cost versus number of options and, you know, jumping to the punchline. We need to move in the opposite direction on scoring and add back in scoring criteria that relate to project maturity and quality, as well as timeline. This should be something more like at least 30% of the score is reflecting the project's maturity in terms of interconnection, permitting status, transmission rights, achievable",

        "text": ". And I think there's sort of two components of that. And the first part would be that the commission has the broad authority over the flexible process. So as we had discussed in our reply throughout the proceeding, just like with a normal motion to dismiss, the commission has the opportunity, when reviewing the filings under to go through to decide the process and how they want to proceed with that. And so, for example, you all could decide a process that was best to handle this motion. And with that, we had suggested the motion to dismiss because you have the authority to determine the process with which you actually want to get to the end result, which is the just and reasonable rate. Now, are, I guess I'm confused. Are you suggesting that we sort of throw out the rules of civil procedure and the things that you admit would apply to a motion to dismiss like the presumption that the facts have to be viewed in the light most favorable to the non moving party? Or, I mean, are you disagreeing that this is a motion to dismiss or are you just suggesting that we throw out the rules that pertain to that CoV is not suggesting that you would throw out the rules or disregard the rules of emotion to dismiss. What we have suggested is that ultimately you have a broad authority and procedurally whether this is understood with the motion to dismiss. What we're asking for is that the, the commission be able to review what is here. Ask whether PGE has met its burden, which is required to you from it when it files and if it has not done that, be able to take some action on that. We've suggested that this would be dismissing the rate case. Does that answer your question? I might just be missing. I think you can move on. I don there's a real answer to this question, but I guess it's hard to square what you're saying with what our legal options are. And I'll just defer to my colleagues if they have other questions I'd like to follow up. So as an expert stakeholder in this process, as Cub has decades of experience in rate cases and in rate making, and often, I think very effectively advocates for a holistic review of cost drivers cost savings opportunities. I'm curious how you evaluated the potential consequences of a dismissal of a general rate case, how that would be heard across the sort of broader stakeholder community, including those who provide capital to PGE and how you thought about potential impacts to customers of a dismissal in the near term, but also sort of over time. Right. As a very precedent setting move that would put Oregon on the national radar. Sure. So when we were considering this, we did, we did not take this slightly. And we recognize that that attracting capital is necessary to support rateayirs. And so what we had hoped for with this rate filing is to bring back more of a balance of the interest of the shareholders and the rate payerss with this motion. And so what we had proposed, for example, was if you did dismiss it, it wouldn't be dismiss. We're not denying the recovery of foodudent costs. We're just saying at this moment that this would be premature and that the company could then refile it later. So what we're trying to achieve is the balance of both what the shareholders interests are as well as the rate pairs, particularly after the rate increases that just occurred. And by doing that, for example, one example of what I'm suggesting would be with the battery trackers would be, rather than trying to have a tracker come in now, you could wait until the batteries are actually used and useful and then recover them that way. So there would be a little bit of regulatory lag that the company would eat, but this would again better balance the interest of the shareholders and the rate pairs within that. So that's one of the examples that we had considered with it. So that's truly what we're trying to get at is just really get back to that balancing component while'recognizing that there are a lot of policy competing or not competing, a simultaneous policy considerations that you're making that may require significant investment. We're just trying to get back to that balancing of the interest of the rate fairers and the shareholders as to this investment. So your hope is that the message that would be taken away is a relatively nuanced message around dismissal because of this is premature and there is s still opportunity for rate making at a later date. That's the message you were hoping that the investment community would hear that, I mean, that is part of our balancing with this motion and what we are considering by saying that they could come back and refile it another time. In terms of the message, one that can commit is this might be a message that is time to actually reset expectations and reset an idea of continuing to procure without really considering that perhaps some of the mandates under that procurement philosophy'not necessarily equal, if not necessarily a blank check, and that you're going to have to make",

        "text": "Good morning everyone. Today is November 2 and we're here for a special public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. All commissioners, all two of us for right now, are present and we're here today to hear about energy trust of Orgons 2024 budgets and the order of events here will be that we'll hear a bit from PC staff introducing where we are and what staff's recommendations on the budget have been. We'll hear from energy trust. They have a slide presentation that they'll go through and then we'll have an opportunity for public comment following energy Trust' remarks. With that, I think I will ask Peter Kernan to come on up and begin our presentation for PUC staff. Good morning, Peter. Good morning chair Decker and Commissioner Tanei. For the record, my name is Peter Kernan, senior utility analyst with energy resources and planning. I'm joined by Michael Colgrove, executive director of Energy Trust of Oregon, and Henry Lorenzen, president of the Energy Trust board of directors. The Energy Trust draft 2024 budget and action plan reflects state law to acquire all cost effective energy efficiency, but it is also more forward looking than past budgets. In addition to cost effective savings for 2024, this year's budget seeks to establish now the infrastructure needed in the not so distant future to accelerate savings to meet the state's decarbonization goals while also ensuring a just transition. The draft budget of 304 millionars includes 298 million of OPUC expenditures for energy efficiency and renewable energy. The draft budget is an increase in OPUC expenditures of 35 and .5% over the 2023 budget. Despite this large increase, the budget still reflects a cost effective portfolio at current levels of avoided costs. Notable expenditure increases include more robust incentives, especially direct installations for those experiencing energy burden and the investments to build necessary infrastructure for future energy efficiency acquisition. Staff supports the proposed budget as it reflects key dynamics in the market and responds proactively to state policy found in house bills 2021 and 24 75. However, as you may have noted from staff's memo, staff has some concerns and makes recommendations in the following areas. First, the need to regularly report on external funding, funding and programs and a more explicit decision making framework that better communicates energy trust principles for those investments. Next, in order to address customer energy burden, the need to leverage utility data to deliver targeted efficiency programs. After that, to better reflect the value of energy efficiency, modernize avoided costs and consider dual fuel and electrification when supporting IRP planning and lastly, to closely monitor administrative cost increases with the large scale up. I won't go into those concerns now, but I will be available throughout the meeting to answer any questions you may have about staff positions. Energy trust budget and Plan 2024 investments have broad support among stakeholders. However, Portland General Electric and Pacific Power provided feedback on certain proposed investments and strategies. Staff appreciates utilities concerns and supports a proposal by Oregon Citizens Utility Board to delay increased utility revenue collections until April 1, 2024, after the highest bills of winter. Importantly, we expect historic levels of upcoming funding for efficiency and clean energy. Both PG and Pacific Power stated the need for more statewide coordination to determine energy trust role in delivery of these federal, state and local programs. Staff supports this idea and looks forward to continue coordination by all parties. In closing, staff supports energy Trust draft 2024 budget as promising in both delivering new savings and renewable energy and building the needed infrastructure for Oregon at a momentous time. Thank you and I'm available for questions or can introduce Michael Colgrove of Energy Trust for his presentation. I want to ask one question, Peter, of you and you can respond to it and then we'll hear from energy trust. And in the course of your presentation you may want to respond to this too. But in staff's recommendations that in the memo that you just briefly outlined here, I'm sort of hearing generally a need forrt guiding principles and oversight of some new interactions between rateairayer funding and other sources. I'm not seeing explicitly a recommendation for more reporting, outcome measurement, documentation, what have you on that kind of capacity building infrastructure that ratepay funds are going to or proposed to go to in this budget. Is that meant to be captured in one of your recommendations? Or would that be sort of additional of. That was on my mind. Thank you. Chairdeckker. I believe Steph intended to get at that with the first two recommendations. So the first recommendation is a request to kind of characterize the ways in which outside external funding is interacting with energy trust funds, just to give people a sense of, you know, when energy dress might be co investing, when they might be delivering a program, or when they might be stepping out because it's being handled by other sources. And the second one, the second recommendation is more of a framework for that decision making process so that",

        "text": ". So this is basically the description of what the council is considering to do its assessment. Next slide. Just very quickly, what we're testing is the resource strategy in the plan. I'm not going to go into details here. The plan does call for some energy efficiency, some demand response, renewables, wind and solar, and more incremental reserves. And this is the strategy that we're testing. And then if you go to the next slide, we're looking at a bunch of different strategies. For example, we're looking at, besides the resource strategies, we're looking at different market conditions in the WECC, for example, limited markets. What if WECC has high demand because they have policies for electrification, etcetera? What if there's global instability and there's a delay in building resources? What if there's early coal retirement? And then what if the WEC is stressed out? What if there's a drought in California that never happens? What if there's a wildfire that never happens? And what if there's a pipeline freeze for gas? Of course these things happen. That's why we want to look and see how they might affect the adequacy in the northwest. We're not evaluating adequacy in all the WHC, just for the Pacific Northwest, but we do take the market dynamics and the market conditions into account. So the next series of slides go through each of the metrics. You can go to the next slide. This shows the resulting loss of load probability for all of those scenarios. The next slide shows the. I believe it shows the Lov or the frequency for all the scenarios. The next slide. And there's a summary slide at the end, so don't worry about this. This one shows the value at risk for the duration. The next slide is the value at risk for peak. By the way, the little rectangles, the colored rectangles that you see here show the provisional limits. So if the horizontal bars exceeded on the right, it means that it violates our limits. If it's inside of that bar means that it's borderline, and if it's on the left, it means that it's tolerable. It's okay. The next one, then, is the value at risk for energy. This looks very complicated, but if you go to the next slide, this summarizes everything in a nice table, little heat map. And so, for all the scenarios that we examined, we show, except for the lo LLP, which is not on here, unfortunately. But we show the lllev, by the way, these are the value at risk for the 97 7.5 case. In other words, these are the values you would get for once in 40 year risk. And so everything that's green here is okay. Everything that's red is not okay, and everything that's in yellow is borderline inside the middle. So what we see here at the top is that if you don't do anything, which is the second line, that's no resource strategy. We have an extremely high frequency, about one event per year, which is ten times higher than what most people would want. And we have a fairly high peak tail end curtailment and very high energy tail end shortfall. What this tells us. But then if we include the minimum resource strategy or the reference resource strategy from the plan, that's line one and line three, everything is green. We also see under different conditions, these things change. There are some takeaways that I think'on there's one more slide after this, which I think is important, which is that the season and time of day, we can go to the next slide. This is a heat map of the maximum shortfall magnitude. So it's not the VAR 97.5. It is the highest that we've seen. But these tables, these matrices, the one on top and the bottom. The one on top is the result using the resource strategy in the plan. The one on the bottom is the one without any new resources. And we show the months of the year, or the rows, or the months of the year, with one being January. And then the hours and the day, obviously, are the columns from one through 24. And all we want to illustrate here is that by, if we don't do anything, we get some very high shortfalls. That's the bottom matrix, which shows lots of problems in the summer, in the middle of the day, and in the winter, we see morning and evening rampt problems in the northwest, and very pretty high numbers. If we apply the resource strategy, resources to this, it becomes the table on top, where we've essentially reduced or eliminated all of the summer shortfalls in the northwest, and we've greatly reduced the winter shortfalls. We haven't eliminated them, but we've reduced them quite a bit. Next slide in conclusion and high level observations, and I think that's all I have left. We might have some. I hope we have some time for questions. The 202",

It happens just occasionally, but it's enough that it just causes the utility and others to dedicate a bunch of resources too to try to, you know, get things resolved and moving and that can have sort of ripple effects down the queue as subsequent projects are looking at what's happening and trying to determine how they want to move forward. Thanks. Now I get it. And I would, I would respond by saying, and know I think ireric likes having clear timelines and requirements for both the utilities and the developers. And so if there is a step in which the timeline for the utility or developer is not clearly defined, that those disputes can be avoided by adding a clear timeline requirement for each party to respondt I think, Yogi, we have those today. To be quite honest with you. I just think that when there's some ambiguity in the queue, projects will do whatever they can to either delay their process to ensure that that ambiguity gets eliminated before they elect to move forward or make a decision on how to move. And it happens from time to time, like I said, and I feel like the rules today are very clear. I mean, it's like we've got know, 15 business days to do certain actions. Same with the developer in signing agreements, right? They've got 50 business days to sign agreements and whatnot. But there's still ways to sort of manipulate that by calling into question certain things about studies or other aspects where frankly if we just said no, you're out of the queue, then they're going to file a complaint or litigation potentially. So it's tough. We're trying to be fair and keeps at the timelines. But also there are times where we have to be understanding because sometimes there legitimate good questions that come back that we feel it warrants delaying so we can give them good answers and try to do our best to resolve any kind of outstanding questions. But it just becomes tough when you've got varying timelines because everybody started off at a different spot in the study process. I'm just trying to highlight it that that's all. And this is Jordan to respond to I think Ted's original question. Obviously we're kind of thinking through this in real time and we've been able to flag some potential complications. I do think that as we've talked through this, it's clear to me that this raises some, you know, bigger issues around process and queue management and timing that perhaps are outside the scope of what we're trying to do in phase one. So maybe this is one of those things we should save till we're talking about more of those type of issues. But again, I'm not trying to say that's the joint utilities position. I'm just kind of providing my initial reaction to Ted's question. So Ted had asked the specific question about this and I think we've had a really good discussion and I appreciate Jason taking the time to explain exactly what you are thinking about. That's great to have in our last couple minutes. I guess. Could we scroll down and could I ask if there are any specific concerns about the, you know, the language from batteries that we're using here to inc incorporate export controls into the study process or that and the fault current provisions or if those seem reasonable and consensus and if you need more time that's okay too. Just curious. I do think we need a little time to take this back so we can do that. I think we. Was it the next workshop where you had tier four on the list? Ted? We can definitely be ready by then I think on this specific question. Yeah, that's the next workshop is tier four. All right, sounds good. Guess I'd be curious hearing, you know, if we could get consensus about skipping the feasibility study at the next workshop too. And it's a quick win. That would be good to know. Or if it needs more discussion and more consideration then I think that'd be good to know too if it' if it's possible. Hi Yogi, this is Mark Bterson. I had a question on the new export controls. I think we talked about this before, but is there going to be a national like standard that those controls will be I guess tested to so we have some confidence what they are? I know there's some, seems like there's some in California but I don't know about national lab type typ thing similar to you 1547 as UL 1741. Throw a bunch of numbers out. But that's how we know that those inverters meet those standards. And I wasn't sure if there's something similar for the export controls or maybe Brian has the answer to that. I'm not sure. Thank you. Yeah, I don't know if we have the export control section written out that we can reference here, but generally you know we would refer to relay relays utilizing like a 32 function or a power control system which is certified and the power control",

So when we're looking at prices on kind of a levelized basis that to some degree can be flattened out. Whereas you know, when you actually look at the high load or heavy load hours from 06:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. compared to just those 4 hours during the day, you do see more of kind of a price difference for the megawatts that the different QS resource types are providing. The other thing that I would also note is, you know, PG did as was mentioned, changed from an untuned ELCC process to a attunedLCC process along with a lot of other changes that are occurring with the utilities portfolio and shifts. And so I think, you know, part of what we're seeing with the changes in the capacity value, you know, maybe is partly due to the overall changes from the IRP, but also a different, more standardized approach for, for kind of measuring ELCC on a um. Consistent and a standardized basis. U so u to Commissioner Taney's point about the changes and solar, you know, I think um, there are a lot of things that go into that, but it is u. The change from an untuned to a tuned DLC is, is a pretty big shift in terms of like what we're trying to really capture with the tuned approach, which is a U 2011 best practice that that true kind of incremental value. Whereas before without tuning the model, the capacity that you're capturing, you know, certainly is still an estimate of that capacity contribution, but it isn't quite as fine tuned to like where the actual a resource fs and the generation profile of that resource into kind of the system overall. And so you know, commission Birkins to your point, you know, a lot of the, the movement generally reflects the, the way that the different resource types assume generation matches up with the assumed need of the resource or the portfolio in 2026 in that snapshot year. And you know, what we see is that the wind, the gorge wind generation profile wasn't hitting as many of those high needat hours as solar. And then you know, with the battery piece of thelipa storage, obviously that can move generation from, from 1 hour to a next to the next. But depending on the way that it integrates with the rest of the system, you know, maybe there isn't sufficient energy to charge those batteries to move the energy around. And so you get those instances where generating resource like solar can really be a large increase in capacity contribution, whereas the Philipra storage, which can move the generation, doesn't see that same increase. But you know, I guess I would note that all of these pieces and highly complex nature of avoided cost and OCC modeling are items that we are looking further at in uM, 2000. And you know, I think staff and hopefully stakeholders are taking a lot of, are getting a lot of kind of takeaways from the issues and items that we're identifying, you know, now and trying to identify ways that we can both improve the accuracy but gain further understanding and transparency through improvements in U 2000. Thank you. I do have another question if you want me to just continue. Yeah, keep going. Keep going until you are satisfied. Thanks. I think another point that the QF trade association brought up and it was a question that I had as well as it went through the document and got a briefing from staff. But it's around the renewal, QF renewal assumption and the QF success rate. And I think it's again, when you look at it just in the staff memo, it's a little hard to understand how that affected, if it did affect the outcome in terms of the proposed pricing. Can you just give a quick. I. I don't think it takes much, but just a quick explanation of how in this particular case that played out. Happy to we door the company for this information. And I think the crux of the comments from the QF trade association are about understanding how this QF forecast might affect ELCCs s for resource throughout the life of that resource, wherein in our current avoided cost methodology, we look at this one snapshot year that is in this filing, the company gave us the list of projects that were due to expire before the 2026 snapshot. Here they applied the 75% multiple to that capacity resource and extended it forward in the LCC modeling. Similarly, for 202 projects, we saw the projects that are in the pipeline, so to speak. And the company took that capacity again, applied to 75% multiplier and included that in modeling. And it did affect the elccs. Trying to see if I have",

        "text": " of procurement, because as you express this morning, I remember, I think it was us. Decker. You know, we only have one or two runs of, I mean, we don't have that many runs of procurement from here to 2030 or from here to 2040. And we don't think community benefits should be an afterthought or something that you gets kind of relegated to either small scale projects or to an eventual date sometime in the future without having a more determined sense of when this might happen. Yeah, I appreciate you articulating that CBI'can be used to evaluate the benefits of community based resources, but also should be available to us to understand more broadly the inplic ##ations of larger procurement decisions. And I appreciate your flexibility in recognizing that the lease cost of risk paradigm is not out the window. It's also always been a place of some flexibility as important issues like resiliency four one, not to put that one above the other ones in the statute, but just on my mind, become more significant and their connection to risk becomes better understood, I guess. Anything else? Commissioner Tony no. I really appreciate this dialogue, and I think this is where asking the company to be sort of as transparent as possible, as opposed to sort of presenting a finished package with a bow on it so that folks can really see how all of these different elements stack up in the preferred portfolio becomes really important because this is complex and nuanced. And so thatt of walking us all through how that preferred portfolio brought all these different multif factorial elements together to optimize becomes really important. Similarly, in we come to the RFSP conversation. Appreciate the unpacking here. Thanks. I do want to say I hear Jake's point as relevant to this too, in the sense that if resiliency and community benefits are a factor, it's not only PGE service territory, potentially that's relevant. We need to understand how people expect us to consider benefits and environmental justice issues within and outside the service territory, how we are to understand resiliency improvements from resources both within and outside the service territory. It's complex, but I think important work to carrying out one of the things that makes HB 2021 different from just a straight line GHG policy. I add to that chair not to make the scope impossibly huge, but I think this is one place where I think a lot about how our historical procurement practices have outsourced environmental harms who mine ash ponds that are not in Oregon, for example, that we're responsible for. And not to say not to make the problem impossibly huge. But that we. When you think. When I think. I know when, for example, is thinking about the river ecosystem, I think about the whole river ecosystem. And so I think we have to be cautious about being. I think we have to make sure we were re not simply outsourcing environmental harm boundaries at that. Okay. Thanks, Sylvia. Let's go to Pat. Thank you, commissioners Decr and Toni. My name is Pat Delaquill. I was part of the energy advocates set of comments, and I want to expand or at least reinforce what Jake and Sylvia have just said. Least cost, at least risk is still viable, but I think the expansion of what we mean by the costs and benefits, it needs to be expanded. It needs to be more inclusive of the various community benefits. And not just issues like resilience and additional reliability, but grid deferrals and other things, things that we can quantify and some things that we can't quantify. And we have to figure out how to deal with those as we go forward in decision making. But I think there's an opportunity here for the commission to take more of a leadership role. I think that community benefit renewable energy projects bring these additional benefits that help Oregonians and help the actual customers of PGE through economic development. And I don't think that's factored in. I think we should be looking at how can we focus the upcoming utility investments to be here in Oregon that helps build the economy of Oregon. And I understand that that may be controversial, but I think that that is a direction that we should be doing more. It's not just enough to provide the least cost energy, it should be the least cost energy that also provides the community economic development and other benefits that we want to see in this state. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate your participation with the energy advocates. Any follow up questions? Okay, thanks. Try to get through this before any more power outages come through our area. Okay. So I had next on the list that I provided, Cbrres, which, again, HB 2021 requires utility clean energy plans to evaluate the. Won't get the words right, but the potential for replacing fossil fuels with community based renewable energy resources. I don't really have any particular follow up questions, except, I mean, some of the follow up questions, really a little bit more",

        "text": " Just very cost effective way to produce energy. Storage, and transmission is still an effective way to integrate those resources. And we're utilizing all cost effective energy efficiency and more demand response than was identified in the 2021 IRP. All right, so here is, you know, the actual resource build or the identified additional resources that we've identified to help serve load as we move forward. I wanted to point out the timing of these conversions in 2024. That's when Bridger units one and two would be converted. 2026 would be volume units one and two and 2030 Bridger units three and four. The economic end of life for bridger units one through four is in 2038. So all of those assumptions align with Pacificors and NV Energy's plans. And when those units come offline, we'll need some firm capacity on the system. So in the same year we have hydrogen plants identified in the plan. Wind and solar is a cost effective way to produce energy on our system, as I identified earlier. And storage, we still see that as being a key part of our plan going forward. We have four hour, eight hour. We even identified some long duration 100 hours storage to help with the needs as we move forward. B two h identified in 2026. And then Gateway west has three phases as shown here. Can I ask you about gas conversion for Valmy? Valmy had been identified of cost effective to retire when it was coal. But then you had a real. You had issues around transmission and being able to get a replacement resource into the interior balancing area, as I recall. How does the model sort of run valy'the? Same. It's still heating water and you'just burning gas instead of coal. And how is it. How are you running it when you make this conversion? Yeah, that's correct, Commissioner Taney. So much of the plant runs the same way it did when it was coal fired. You're just replacing the burner and burning natural gas rather than coal. And. Yeah, that's. That's how those conversions operate so much. A lot of the plant characteristics remain the same. Ok. Okay. So it's just a matter of then what is your gas contract? What's your price of gas? And. And Valmy has gas. There's gas availability towards volumy or in. It's getting hot in there. So I'm moving out of the shark for sh was. I was starting to worry about whether you were getting enough air in there. So thanks for taking care of yourself, but also bringing a little, little sparkle to the day. There's a fan in there just to make sure that I was breathing something rather than just my own carbon dioxide. But yeah, the heat starts to get you. So yeah, thanks for being patient with that. Okay, any further questions on this slide? No, I think I see. I know that you're syncced up now with Pacific Core and andv energy and that's been an open question. So that's interesting to see how your conversations are holding with them. So thanks. Anytime. Even with those higher loads that I showed and more flexible generation held ono a little bit longer in our plan, we're seeing significantly reduced emissions as the plan progresses. So yeah, what you're seeing here is these are our historical emissions in the solid green. And obviously we know that emissions are pretty contingent upon hydro as well as temperature through the year. So you do see that go up and down, though, trending in the downward direction, especially if you go further back. Is the trendline like weather normalized or that's just a straight. That's just the straight trend line that we were trying to show? Yes, it's still trending down. Temperature normalized or we normalized. We'd expect that trend line to be a little bit steeper. On the right side is our forecast. The solid line is the 2023 IRP forecast. And the dotted line is the 2021 IRP forecast. A couple of reasons that there's a gap there at the beginning. One is just changes in assumptions between the modeling of the 21 IRP and the 23 IRP. And then you may remember in the 2021 IRP, we identified a lot of wind and that didn't materialize on our system. We ended up getting solar and storage in our rfps rather than a large amount of wind. We do anticipate having wind on our system and you can see that kind of bringing the emissions down in around 2027. But then, yeah, as it advances and as we're able to incorporate more of those renewable resources, we see that trend line continue to drop down. That big drop is also at the same time that you're converting, sort of, you're converting three, four Coe units to gas across that same drop. So it's, that fuel switch is driving up some of that drop, I presume. Yeah, that's correct. We're seeing some",

        "text": " that the 2025 deficiency date was acknowledged by the commission and that'something that we can figure out from the commissions order and that's why you're keeping that date. I don't have any other better information and we could read it in there or not, but we perform the calculations to the best of our understanding. Yeah. And iron I think that's, you know, generally a fair characterization and so this could just be resolved by looking at the order. What is it? 240 seven three. Yeah. I mean, I'm not as familiar with the IRP as many of the people on the call, but, so I can take a look at. It would be good for other people to take a look at it, but I think we're in a situation where, at least from everything I've heard, is that the company is not planning on acquiring resources in 2025. And it would surprise me if the commission clearly acknowledged a 2025 resource acquisition. But I'm not as involved as other people. This strikes me as something similar to what happened a number of years ago when the Oregon legislature passed Senate Bill 1547 and the company came in for an IRP update. After that, law doubled the RP's and the company said it was going to be going out and acquiring a huge amount of new renewables. But they proposed avoided costs that showed that they were not. The avoid costs didn't show them acquiring renewables during the entire planning period. So there was a huge disconnection between what the company filed and what its actual plans were. So that seems to be a similar circumstance here where there's a huge disconnection between what the company's plans are and what the avoided cost filed rates show in terms of resource acquisitions. So I think absent something that is really clear that the commission acknowledged this 2025 deficiency sufficiency period and that we need to follow that. Notwithstanding the fact that everybody knows that that's unlikely to be the actual thing, I think that we should probably look at and have a different sufficiency deficiency denarcation. Well, if I could follow on to what Irian is saying, as Dan stated, the company has a capacity need. There's language suggesting that procurement of battery resources in the near term, outside of an RFP, might be able to help cover that capacity shortfall. Would this indicate that there might be a better deficiency start date to use? I mean, what is, is there anything known about this, how the company plans to cover that capacity need? There's not a lot known. I mean, we are likely to do things to serve customers that are both short term and long term. Exactly when those start, you know, up in the air. So the idea that we could sign a contract for a long term wind resource, I think, which is, or I forget whether it's wind or solar, but one of those assets for a 2025 COD at this date and time is no longer plausible. So, I mean, that's a reasonable assumption. The amount of time between execution and commercial operation, you know, seven months, is not plausible. So's there's definitely ways one could get to a different deficiency period. And, you know, within the IRP update itself, you know, the first new resource not, you know, signed in, that was in 2027. So, you know, as far as most recently filed in public plans, those are that 2027 would be the date. Okay, I really appreciate that, Dan, that is helpful. And toward that end, you know, part of this package of updated IRP inputs includes things like an any side solar resource as an updated renewable proxy resource. And I believe that's a 2025 resource. I mean, do you have any, you know, idea of how, I'll just say changed or updated reality might affect that proxy resource? I mean, in the 2023 IRP update, there is still east side solar resources. In 2027, there's also eastide wind resources and some batteries attached to the solar, I believe. So the cost of those, I believe is identical. In the different years between the 23 IP and 23 IP update, those were, that cost decline curve doesn't begin to decline until a little bit later in the horizon, is what was assumed in the 23 RP, and that hasn't been modified for the 23 IRB update. And then I'm going to ask a few questions, I suppose, about all these proxy resource, you know, maybe smaller updates regarding the solar and wind and integration cost schedule, what the companies's delayed plan to delay of resource acquisitions, you know, affect the flexible reserve study from the 2023 IRP. Certainly we could recalculate the reserve requirements specific to any portfolio, and any portfolio change would, would impact those results. We haven't done that calculation. In general, the trends that you see there is relatively high in the",

        "text": " it very difficult to make any headway with, with those small utilities. I mean, their argument is principally turns on, it's just about cost, and they don't see an appetite for change among their customers. And frankly, because they're getting pretty flat cost power from Botleville as a whole, all in product, they look at Bonneville'their, efficiency program is being not necessarily cost effective to them. It's just a cost that they incur. And they don't really, they claim that they don't see any real benefit from it. And there's, frankly, I think it all starts at the top. Not necessarily it's at Bonneville, but also the leaders of the utilities. They really have to move to explain the benefits. But I ll just want to add in briefly that Oregon and Washington have always been very progressive in their policies, always looking forward, I think, at least since the 1980s, and it won't be very long, maybe ten years. We're going to hear talk within this region about the 100th anniversary of Grand Coulee Dam and Bonneville Dam and some of the others. It really points to aging of our system and the impacts on the environment that it's created and moving forward in new policies, new technologies that could end up reducing costs over time. And that's difficult from a regulator's position, because economic decisions, they can be made over a period of time. But you really see in a ARR case, it's a snapshot in time based on the studies that you receive form the evidence of the case. But, so it's a slow process. But I think the tribes recognize that as well. I mean, as sovereigns and governments, they understand the push and pull of policies and the difficulty in making decisions that affect people's lives, but just appreciate the opportunity to work with you and to offer where we can the tools that we have at our disposal. I'd ask, add one other thing. When I was first executive director of the power council, getting building codes passed in Washington and Oregon was a challenge. The building trades are very powerful in the legislature. And frankly, my observation is the only way we really made progress is we came up with really good information about the cost effectiveness of the measures that we are recommending for those codes. And we recommended a 10% surcharge on BPA's rates if people didn't implement the codes. And all of a sudden the utilities went from being kind of opponents to realizing, oh my gosh, we could be facing a surcharge under the Northwest Power act. We better get to the legislature and get these things passed. And they did. Yeah. Interesting. Well, so much history and really so much promise for working together in the future. As Commissioner Thompson said, hearing what your interests are really helps us understand where we may be able to bring your expertise to bear in some of our proceedings and really where we may be able to analyze the impacts that we're having on a broader range of communities in our region. I know that you are engaging on these issues, whether it is storage, time of use rates, energy efficiency, cost effectiveness at a really detailed technical level, and had some questions for us around what we can do in terms of promoting storage on site solar time of use rates. And I'd really like to continue the working relationship that has started through this conversation today and encourage you to keep working with our executive office to deepen the conversation by talking with PUCC staff who work on these issues. Your report called out our distribution system planning effort. I think that's a place where engagement could be really. I think we have active initiatives going on right now to extend our purpa pricing regime to storage resources. I think there's a lot of fruit for further conversation, but we'll need to take those to another forum and to another meeting date. But like my colleagues have said, I think we have learned a whole lot about the commission, its history, its work, and how we can work together going forward. Is there anything that your team would like to say by way of conclusion here? Chairman, anything you want to chime in with? Yes, just some clos in observations from Laison. Just some. I think in reading the Biden Trudeau joint statement, mainly regarding the Columbia River Treaty, there was a, a listing of a lot of funding availability through mainly the us government and Congress. I think that it's important to have a more transparent system because in many cases, sometimes the tribes are having to share funded with other sovereigns such as the state. And basically we need to know the rules and the laws that apply to that funded resource. I think that something else that caught my attention is colal phase out. I think it's critical to the tribes and the water and the fish resources and the environment is a critical issue for us to kind of put that under the umbrella of the climate change strategy. What I think would benefit the tribes the most and this is internal, maybe to crick",

The only one that awareness that I have a desire to do that for or I'm happy to do that, but the only one I would elevate for that discussion is the expectation 22 around attachment c. I think that conversation clarified things for me there, but I think that's an important to make sure that we've talked about. Does that sequence of conversations sound okay? It does. Okay, great. So starting off then I find myself interested and a little torn by this conversation about non acknowledgment of the long term plan. I just to cut to the chase, when I'm torn like this, I sometimes am inclined to go with staff's recommendation, especially when it's well supported by a variety of stakeholders. The reason I'm torn is because I think one Avista has ra really valid questions about what does this mean? But I think those are answerable about why we'd be doing this. And then the second reason I'm torn is because of where we ended this conversation, which is that there's a really high level of engagement in attempting to get to the right planning future. And there really can't be a world where we can never acknowledge a long term something's wrong if we can never acknowledge a long term plan because the world is uncertain. Yet I think I have various reasons that I can offer why on balance, I'm inclined to land where staff did and the primary one, and then I'll just stop talking and see how aligned we are on this. It's just the signaling function, frankly. It's a signal one of a shift in how how the world has caused gas companies to need to change the way they think about how portfolio different resource strategies perform in the future. But it's also a signaling for me to the broader policy environment that says there's not an obvious path here to meeting something like the CPP. And if it's expensive and maybe not possible, we need to be really honest about that. Those are my reasons for on balance, siding there. I think this is one of those things where the binary is frustrating to me because I don't think that at this moment there at least I can't see a prudence implication here. Maybe when we talk about some of the action items, to your point, maybe there are risk mitigating things that aren't being done in the near term. I feel like having to say we acknowledge or we don't acknowledge is a little bit frustrating when you're trying to say the guidance is something isn't quite there that needs to change to make us feel comfortable that we're grappling with the right things about the future. But anyway, that's just neither here or there. It's the process we have right now. I appreciate that, and I very much appreciate AV visas, posture and effort. I think this was really different from the dialogue we were having with northwest Natural in their last IRP around facing the complexity and uncertainty out in the future. And I think in part we were all finding our way to not a different planning paradigm, but a planning paradigm that prioritizes answers to a different kind of question than we have asked. The gas companies and avysta sort of caught in that learning, but I see them willing and actively engaging in that learning where it was more frustrating conversation. And so I appreciate how select how going with staff recommendation loses a nuance in the companys posture. And at the same time I think all of these irps have really highlighted the very challenging set of trade offs that are out in front of the gas industry. And I mean the reality is were not going to do all of one or all of the other of any of these decarbonization, were not going to entirely electrify or entirely do replacement gases. Its I think",

        "text": " implementation of this legislation, and we tend to do any notifications on the smaller dockets that flow out of this through that docket as well. So if you're following on um, 20 211, for the most part you're seeing things that come through on these other smaller dockets. So this is a non contteested docket, and it has been deciding many important policy questions. So as I mentioned earlier, it's one of those dockets where the commission is making its decision at a public meeting and which you typically engage in through staff prior to the public meeting. And now it has spurned a bunch of other individual dockets that are applicable to individual utilities. So a bunch of different advice filings. And what are advice filings? Well, advice filings are dockets in which utilities are looking to change, not their wholesale rates as they do potentially in a rate case, but a smaller portion of their rates in this case. Terms and conditions associated with low income customers or differential rates. Typically, but not always, these advice filings are non contested dockets. So they're a bit easier to participate in these, just some of those smaller dockets. So as you latch onto an issue, say this low income or differential rate issue, you might get engaged in a larger docket, but then you also might find that you want to get engaged on more specific dockets that flow out of it. Another example of this type of situation is the docket number, um, 2165, which is around transportation electrification. This is another non contsted docket. Just to give you a flavor of how it works in this non contested docket staff, it's like an iceberg. A little bit. The top of the iceberg is that commission decision, where the commission gets together at a public meeting and reviews a recommendation from staff and makes a decision that is then ultimately affecting a utilities transportation electrification investments. But there's a lot that goes into that, all the hidden part of that iceberg that goes up to the public meeting, and that's where participation is really important. So in the case of one of the recommendations in HB, sorry, in, um, 2000, 165, that docket, seven staff led workshops led to a final recommendation. So there were seven meetings that staff held with utilities and other stakeholders reviewing what they were going to recommend, discussing the policies, listening to people, getting reactions, proposing things, and then ultimately all that went before the commission. Of course, you always have the opportunity to participate at that last stage where the commission is considering a decision. But as you can see, a lot of action went on before that, and it might be a good idea to participate in that as well, or it might be extremely important to participate in that. So, Jessica, I see you have a question. Did you already say how, you know, based on a filing or docket number, if it's a contested case or not, or what bucket it fits into? Yeah, I did not say that. So that's a good question. If you see a contested case is will ll have a notice of contested case rights filed in Medocet. So if there is no notice, then it is not a contestant case. So you'll see that in the list of documents. And usually it's pretty early. Typically we issue the notice of contested case rightsites when we issued the pre hearing conference notice. So it's something that happens pretty early in the docket. It's not very clear. In fact, what I'd like to do is we're doing a docketing system change, and I'd like to make sure that it's very clear to the public, sort of in a headline way, if a docket is contested or not contested, but that is the way to figure it out. Look for that notice. If it's not there, then it's a non contested docket. And of course, the staff principal can tell you, anyone associated with a docket can tell you, Corey, you have a question or comment? Just a question on, I'm assuming all these are house bills for Oregon state, and I'm wondering, do you do any dockets for federal regulation or policy, or is that kind of under the jurisdiction of FERC? Yeah, that's a good question. Absolutely. It does come up. I mean, federal requirements will impact what we do. For example, when we had the, before the 2016 election, we had a lot of work on climate change and clean energy planning associated with the EPAs greenhouse gas rules. New rules are coming. We anticipate that happening again. When we had the big tax legislation a few years ago, there were a lot of dockets associated with that. There are federal actions that will cause individual dockets here. The IRA is certainly causing a lot of action in individual dockets. So we do react to federal policy. So let's talk a little bit about how you ought to think about participating in these non contested advice",

        "text": "Good afternoon. Today is March 21, 2023, and this is a special public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. All commissioners are present and we are here today to talk about two distribution system plans. From Pacificorp in Docket, uM, 21 98 and from Idaho Power in, uM, 21 96, Nick Sayhan will be presenting both of these for staff and will be giving us a little insight into staff's review of these plans and presenting staff's recommendation, which of course, is contained within the memos. While we welcome Nick up to the screen here, we'll just thank him as we did when heard about Portland General Electric's distribution system plan a week or two ago. We'll just thank Nick for the really comprehensive effort that he's made to be thoughtful in how these plans are being reviewed, to be looking for emergent issues in these first iterations, and really pointed toward what's working well, what we as commission and utility and stakeholder community need to work on going forward to continue to improve the distribution system planning process. So thanks, Nick, for your work in this area. And we look forward to hearing, I guess, first about Pacific Corp's plan. You're welcome, chair er, thanks for the kind words. Just checking you can hear me. Okay, excellent. Thank you. I just need to move Zoom on my desktop so I can see the things that I would like to see. Okay, great. So then, officially, good afternoon, chaird Decker, Commissioner Tawy and Commissioner Thompson. For the record, my name is Nick say and I'm a senior utility analyst in the resources and program development section of the Energy Resources and Planning Division. I'm joined today by Natasha Smith, assistant attorney general at the Oregon Department of Justice. As noted, I'm here today to present the basis for staff's recommendation for Pacific Powersgo organ distribution system plan part two and answer questions that may come up in your deliberations. I'd like to thank Kristy Collins in advance for her assistance with our slides today. Kristy, go ahead and advance to the next one. I'm leaving my meeting with Op. Go ahead. We got it muted. Great. Thanks, Christriy. Today I would like to note the action before the commission and then review staff's recommendation. Next, I'll discuss several aspects of Pacific Power's plan. I'll note stakeholder feedback and then finally discuss some next steps. Next slide, please. The action before the commission today is acceptance. This was true in considering PGE's plan as true for considering Pacific powers plan now, and also for considering Idaho powers plan later in the meeting. As stated in the DSP guidelines, acceptance means the commission finds the plan meets the criteria and requirements of these guidelines. Acceptance does not constitute a determination on the prudence of any individual actions discussed in the plan. Next slide, please staff recommends that the commission accept Pacific Powers plan. A plan has numerous strengths and meets the guidelines. Next slide, please I'll now present several aspects of Pacific Powers plan. However, I'd like to begin by stepping back to look at the big picture. The plan presents an estimated annual investment in the distribution system of $250 million per year. Applying this amount across the action plan results in an estimated total investment of $1 billion from 2023 to 2026 that includes a variety of project categories, from new connections to asset replacement. Taken altogether, Pacific Powers plan demonstrates significant evolution of the company's distribution planning practices, and it provides detailed and clear insight for non technical audiences on very complex topics. Aspects of the plan that I note in my remarks today represent just a percentage of the overall activity and investment presented in the plan. And I'd like to note these are not the three best aspects of the plan or the worst. They're intended instead as diverse examples that include strengths and opportunities for improvement. First, I'll address investment planning. As I noted a moment ago, we now have more insight into upcoming utility investments. This is especially so for investment in the company's distribution planning capacity. These investments include things like staffing, stakeholder engagement and communications, non wire solutions, pilots, and data and software improvements. The investments also includeal capital projects such as extending SCaDA capability to all Oregon substations and continuing existing distribution automation pilots. For these investments, the plan provides specific information on activities, timing, and estimated costs. However, for investments in the grid, the plan provides limited insight into trends, project decision making, or how projects connect to the grid needs and solution identification processes, and this is an opportunity for FE future improvement. Increased insight into grid investments will be important moving forward in understanding decision making from any policy areas. These include decision making for elect excuse electric vehicle charging, investments for transportation, electrification planning, grid hardening investments for wildfire planning, or investments enabling community based renewable energy projects for clean energy planning. And I'll note that I discuss this issue for",

        "text": " of us are taking too much risk, but we're able to really understand some of those emerging companies. So one example would be the Pano camera technologies that we're using in wildfire prevention. And that has been tremendously successful in a very short period of time. Then finally, I sit on the secretary of energy's advisory board. And as part of the Smart grid working group, we've prepared two white papers for the Department of Energy. One around transmission and distributed energy resources in the distribution system. And then the other one is we get more into specific technologies in the distribution system around of a virtual power plant and technology. So while we fully appreciate that we are a utility deploying our customers dollars in proven, reliable fashion, we do stay abreast so that we can make sure that we're getting the benefit of the tremendous change that's taking place across our entire ecosystem. And we've been able to make a big difference in lowering our own operating costs better serving customers and transforming on how we integrate wind, solar and battery storage. In fact, I don't know if you are aware, but the Wheat Ridge energy facility was the first of its scale to combine all three technologies and really better utilize that very significant and scarce transmission resource. So while we are not an innovator, it gets to that partnership strategy we were talking about. Yeah, thanks. I really appreciate that and your, your view on that balance. And so I'm really happy to hear about those instances where, you know, you take advantage of the opportunity to learn from others and also to be involved as a leader on those topics as well. So I guess the second question, I'll just ask it and then I'll step back. But one of your first slides, I think it was on the far right where it talked about perform. You raised kind of indirectly the importance of investors right in the company. And I fully recognize it. We all recognize that investors are an important part of your ability to deliver on utility service, because after all, that's where you get your financing and your funding to be able to make investments on behalf of customers. And I really appreciate that your presentation was focused on customers and decarbonization and serv, serving Oregonians, you know, which I know is your mission and desire. I also appreciated you highlighting the financial goal that you have with respect to earnings growth each year. I think five to 7% earnings per share growth. And I just was wondering if you could comment a little bit more, how should we as regulators, and I think about that goal in the context of what we do, which is tend to think about, you know, Roe, that's awarded in a rate case, for example. But you have other desires that, you know, shareholders come to you with, with respect to growth. How does that fit into your overall strategy? Kind of in a way that you're trying to benefit all of these different interests that you serve. Sure. So first of all, we exist first and foremost to serve customers. And I think it's really important that we recognize that years ago, ourselves and others, utilities were really created at the intersection of a public good and driving, cost effective electric service and energy service with the needs for a lot of capital. And whether that is capital in the form of equity and debt fundraising, or whether that is capital in the form of bank lines of credit or insurance, all of that pool of capital. So really we're at the intersection of a public good and essentially Wall street and capital formation. Just this past years, you know, we raised just about a billion dollars in both equity and in debt. And that allows us to at a low cost because both we sold about 11% of our company and we raised very cost effective low interest rate financing that allows us to put that money to work for customer growth, for aging infrastructure, for transformation, and being able to deliver really enough capitalization for funding into the future. As we take a look at balancing all of those aspects of a competitive return on investment and earnings growth for our shareholders and capital providers, we're also looking at our ratings with Moody's and s and P for the stability and security of our debt holders. Keep it, making sure that customer prices are affordable and balancing that also with ensuring reliability in the system while then finally also making sure that we're investing for the future and energy transformation. When we look at capital sources going forward, and it's why I emphasized it and Larry did as well, we now have another source of funding, and that is all of the advantages of the Inflation Reduction act and the investment in Jobs act. And those funds will really help offset both the impact of customer prices as well as, as the needs for external fundraising. And so to balance out what is a high growth period of time, we're really being very focused on bringing that kind of funding into our utility and into the state of Oregon. And we have a number of really important and exciting projects that we're",

        "text": " I have no incentive or structure mechanism to really bring those forward because there is no mechanism to contemplate how they would be scored or preferred or any benefit aside from PGE's discretion and some unknown way. I really encourage you to think about how the RFP process could be opened up to facilitate this. And you've heard me say before, we need to score benefits. The state talked about those benefits. It is the policy of the state, the maximument is practical to pursue these types of benefits. And, you know, jobs benefits to communities. There's a lot of overlap in the language between the CBR definitions and the policy of the state for what should come from these things. What we need is something that allows the market to do this, not funnels at all through PGE's limitations on IRP modeling and procurement. That leads into this little narrow box that looks like a bunch of little tiny things that really could be on the scale of keeping communities like bend online when wildfire events happen and saving lives while simultaneously decarbonizing. Thank you. I recognize how it can seem like bureaucracy. I don't know that the market has any better way of delivering the kinds of qualitative values that the statute calls out and appreciate that the community impacts advisory group is there to inform this, and that takes a little bit of time. So I think it's moving at the pace of getting these folks involved rather than just throwing developers at the problem. Appreciate your comments and also would just suggest that there are other things going on here besides PGE's discretion to implement the statute as it's bring. If I may, though, some sort of something that we can respond to as we're entrepreneurs, as a lot of IPP folks are. There are lots of ways we could approach cooperating, collaborating, partnering with all of the target communities that are intended to benefit from this. But candidly, there's not any pathway we foresee where that makes sense to do this at scales that would really bring this, you know, first of all, bring the cost down. AWX focus is appropriate, right? If you make these all two megawatt and 1 projects, you're driving costs up. And conversely, we can be innovative, but there is no signal. And it may be that how we score these things need to go through a certain process, but some of them are simple and we already know, for example, jobs. I mean, the first read of all of this, notwithstanding all of the intentions around this, is the statute says very clearly what things comply. And so if we bid into an RFP, we should be able to say we created local jobs. We came up with a solution with a backup battery that would keep the lights on at a tribe where the project was CED, where it wheels power to Portland most of the time. But is s available for backup resiliency. We can do these things at, you know, tens and dozens and hundreds of megawatt scales, but right now they're just, I don't see a pathway in where this is going that encourages it. And functionally, PGE has constrained the solution set to very small numbers that are inconsistent with the scale of the opportunity and need, and to me feel a bit diminutive to those that this was intended to benefit, which should be looking at potentially billion dollar scale benefits distributed throughout the state and bringing that type of resiliency and community benefits rather than, you know, a couple of things, you know, that are much smaller and much more expensive proportionally. Thanks. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Moving on to the transmission alternatives analysis. I think that I don't have all of the record completely in mind, but I think the point here is that there were some action items around pursuing particular transmission projects, and then there were a lot of questions that said, hey, have you considered these projects relative to other transmission alternatives or as we've heard a lot about today, alternative pathways? Have you also considered the timing of any necessary course correction? Assume the costs and benefits favor the transmission builds. What a course corrections look like. If you see delays there, I want to make sure that since this is a big component of what we want or what staff has recommended that and the company has agreed to do going forward. But at least we have aigned understanding of what this is supposed to be about. Commissioner Tani, I know you said you had some questions specific to the transmission analysis, so I'll let you kick it off. Well, I guess I understand the transmission is, I mean, I understand the constraints that are facing the transmission system. I also understand the serial ##eing in the interconnection inside the BA is quite, quite clogged up and not cost free. And I'm wondering from the company, what do you envision the sort of end result of this analysis is and how decision makers in your company, in us outside, might be able to use the analysis?

So a group of us went together and hired a firm to basically patrol our community, particularly at night, because we also had some threats of some art issues and SM others. But again, it is fire is an issue because the homes I've seen that have been burned in the area, pretty much all this leftu maybe is the shell they just. There just isn't the facilities there to really respond in equipment with that. Thank you for coming. Appreciate it. Okay, thanks for being here. My name is Jeannie Braun and I live on Gagero. My property bax to Stafford. We bought property 30 years ago and the power pool will be right in back of the view out of my kitchen window, which is a pastorial view right now. We also have a lot of trees along that stretch where the line is proposed. And they will, will or not will maybe be cut down, or maybe not cut down. So what happened? And I really appreciate Kelly's comments. I had the same exact experience with the field services company. They offered me a dollar amount. It was a pittance. And PGE called and said, oh, no, we can't offer you that. Even we'renna just cut that down about five, $5,000 because that other information that they sent you in the letter was incorrect. And I'm like, well, that's weird, but it doesn't even matter because my realtor came over last week and we're getting ready to sell our house to our children. And we have another piece of property on Stafford Road on the other side and it's up by homesteader. The power pools will go on that property as well. We own that for ten years. It used to be a nursery and staff farms and nursery is now the name of. It is a business that I have. I had it ten years ago. We bought the property over there. They won't need an easement on that property. But after we purchased that property, I had a farm store on there. I was a member of the farm loop. If you own twelve acres or five acres or two acres on Stafford, you's an EFu, right? And so your exclusive farm use. If you have a farm or you want to pay your taxes on that land, the only farming you're actually going to be able to make any money on is a hobby farm. I grised pumpkins. I am from a farming community and in the valley. My dad was a grass seed farmer. My family still has acres down there. You need 500 to 1000 acres to make any kind of dent in buying the equipment to harvest that kind of thing. And maybe you can buy great, plant some grapes here and there. But as a rule, the scenic ro along that has been designated on Stafford Road is rural. My property on Gage that I've lived in on for 30 years is's surrounded by dry fields and grass in the summer. The power poles are right behind me right now. It's livable, of course, because they were there when we bought it. We all need power. I'm not against the project, I'm against where they're siding it. The points. I won't go over all the points that my neighbors have already explained to you, but I agree with them all. And I think as a professional in the road construction business, I have some things that we do. Heavy highway, mostly street and road. And we do that with federal government, the local government work Wax county, city for all around the state of Oregon and Washington. And I actually know what traffic control plans are like and what is allowed under the Oregon rules for temporary traffic control. If you're going to start a project on Stafford Road that is going to go one to two years and you're going to have such a bottleneck. So right now the city of Boville closed Beckman Road for a year to build a bridge over that dip in the roadach. So then they had to put a light in adjacent to my property in order to there's a little cluster back there where Stafforde my language, Stafford and 65th and elling all come together there, right? We all know that that's little non's land because, you know, city of Bovill doesn't own it. There's, you know, a lot of traffic back up there, right? And with Zoom or ways, you know, everyone takes a shortcut in the 205 for the I five backt, right. I'm not one of those people that says, oh, not in my backyard. Okay, first of all, we all need power. It's insulting in the way PG has treated us all. When I agreed to meet with them on my property, they were 45 minutes late. I work, I have a job. They didn't apologize. They came over my neighbor's property and she called and wanted me to come over and sit with her.",

        "text": " about what you can and can't do. The first big letter B does result in an expected annual net outut that is not greater than 10%. I think that knot should come out and I know it's just a typo that we can fix, but in case the word not can be pretty significant. So I just wanted to be explicit that I think that comes out of there. I agree and I've done that to make sure we take out and that we include in any motion. Thank you. That would be consistent with the memo. Thank you, chair. Okay, well, at risk of being. Well, no, I don't know. I guess I was gonna. Yeah. Anyway, I was going to ask about the storage issue, but I'm pretty sure I understand that. So I think we'll just leave it alone. But maybe we shouldn't. Maybe we should. Again, respecting that this is sort of just a newsworthy item that is reasonable to try to ask about as we're adopting this rule. My understanding is that the latest word on the facility size, at least for purposes of the threshold for what is a QF, is that the send out maximum is the touchstone. So if there's storage that's functioning to change the time of that the production occurs, that's not sort of added to the facility's overall capacity. Does anyone. I think it might be useful to hear if anyone sees that that would be different in how our rules are interpreted. And I'm not trying to like reopen the record to talk about this. I'm just. I think this is just like a legal interpretation. My understanding is we've been discussing these rules is consistent with your understanding, chair, that it's what the maximum that could come out like in a solar facility. You might be talking about the other side of the inverter, what's behind that? And I say that as a lawyer, not an engineer. Yeah, yeah. Understood. And I know that was what Fer said. It's just, it was been in the news lately, so I thought I asked about it. Ok, so next is force majeure. I think that we talked about this in our previous workshop and had a relative level of agreement that we were wanting to remove the specificity about force measure provisions from the rules as well, recognizing that they will be in the contracts and they will be subject to interpretation. Force measure type events occur. I just want to say I understand the arguments for specifying this because there are unique, I don't know, unique factors for our industry that having a rule could help provide guidance on to those that are interpreting or drafting aforcementure for provision. But I still fall out in favor of a general tendency to want to be really open to sharing our roles with the courts on contract provisions that are, that have a large body of work behind them in the world of contract law. And I guess I just thought it was worth restating why I was supportive of not including that role, but I don't think we needed to really talk about it further unless someone sort of disagrees with that rationale. All right, so we are then on to new rule one, which is actually the 0044, just after the definitions or a couple rules after the definitions here. And boy, we've had a lot of interesting discussion of this one at our last rulemaking hearing. And while this is complicated, you, I've spent time going over it and feel like I really am comfortable with where this is landing. And I not only that, but I think it's important that we spell this out explicitly in a rule rather than sort of relying on our case precedent to answer these kinds of questions. I have a little bit of like a detail point that I want to ask about. But before we get into that, I just want to say that I recognize that the utilities have requested that something like this be inserted into the rules for on system qfs as well. And at risk of saying things in a way that's not 100% accurate, I want to explain why''m comfortable not doing that. And I put this out there just because I would like to hear from Judge Mae or Stephanie or the other commissioners if they think this is not a good reason to reject that invitation by the utilities. So why I think we're doing this, adopting this rule for off system qualifying facilities is because they're interconnecting to a system other than the purchasing utilities. There is no opportunity for the network resource interconnection study process to identify any kind of deliverability related network upgrade load deliverability network upgrade requirements before the PPA is signed. And so this is the sort of problem that we confronted previously. I just want to say I recognize that the network resource interconnection service process does not necessarily reveal everything transission that the network transmission service request might for on system QF and that there is a gap there and that we are, I gu taking on the that gap, taking on the risks of cost related to that gap on behalf",

        "text": " well. And I think that pretty much sums up where Ireac is at. Thanks. Y go ahead, Lisa. No, go right ahead. Thank you. Sure. Yeah, I just wanted to jump in to see. I think this is one of those issues that engendereded some discussion. I think the utilities have heard some things from ireac that they weren't, you know, aren't totally prepared to respond to with specificity. But it's been really helpful to hear and understand the discussion. We've got a couple few different utilities here a little bit differently situated. So, so I'm not sure at this point anyone's, you know, really prepared to say this is a summary of the utilities position. What I can say is that we can certainly be happy to take back the discussion today and come back and provide more specificity, maybe pull together something that feels like a utility position that sort of makes most sense to folks. If that works for staff. Sure, that sounds great. And I know the next meetings on January 31, so they're like just two weeks away. Is that going to give you enough time for that? Honestly, I don't know the answer to that question, but let me, we can find out in ##ircle back with you before then. Ted okay, sound certainly try. That would be a goal. We'll set it as a goal and let you know if it seems like it's not going to work. Okay. And staff'hoping to have something at the FE 15th meeting that will have synthesized most of the red lines. And there will be, this may be an issue where consensus is not reached, but that's what staff aiming for right now. Okay, that's very helpful, Ted. I think we will know, definitely endeavor to make sure we think about and synthesize the sort of utilities positions and concerns so that you can take that into account. Sounds good. So if we're done with the penetration screens, did you have something else, Yoki, to move forward on? Yeah, I had some quick items on tier three and then the level for study process, since we still have time that, that we could address. So, Stacey, I think you can stop sharing your screen now. I'll move on to the tier three non export process quickly. And that is, you know, we've had extensive discussions about the new export control section from the batteries project. We have consensus on most of what's included there. And if there's a little bit of non consensus items that, that the commission's going to have to work through about exactly the, you know, the wording on some of the export controls. But it seems like the whole concept of, you know, which screens will use the export capacity, in which screens we use, the nameplate rating where we're on the same page about how to implement that change. And so with that, it seems like most projects that are non export are likely to use that export control section and move through either the tier one or tier two process. And I guess I'm thinking that as a result, there might not be many projects that will go through the non export tier three. And so, you know, for example, you know, with the recent rules that were issued out of New Mexico, you know, those didn't include a comparable non export process for tier three, again, with the expectation that with the new export control section, all those projects would just go through tier one or tier two. And I guess I'm wondering how much tier three is being used for non export projects today and if it would be appropriate to have those just go through tier one and tier two. I'm wondering if we even need to continue having a separate tier three process now that we're going to have the export control section. So that was something that I wanted to open up, I guess, with the first question being do we have any slash many projects using the existing tier three today? I. Eric, I could take this one. This is Jason Zavy from PGE. We typically get anywhere from. Well, the last couple years, we've gotten roughly about five to seven projects that are applying under the tier three kind of non export process. It varies. Some of them are sort of storage only type projects to both. To projects that contain both, you know, storage and solar. So, you know, we get half a dozen a year. Right. So it is being used. So I think that. And I've reached out to OA and the other trade associations to get their feedback on the, as well. And I haven't, um, I haven't heard back, but I think because it's being used, I'm gonna. If it wasn't being used, I think I was just going to propose deleting it. But since it is being used, I think it's probably worth hearing from the folks that are using it if they want to continue to have that as an option U or, you know,",

So you're leaving it up to whoever you have a staff in that particular case that's going to be able to understand and get to the bottom of these issues. In a rate case, which happens very quick, you have short discovery timelines. It's really difficult to catch items at this level of granularity. Okay, thank you. Appreciate that opening. I'd like to move on just in the interest of time. Thank you. And ask anyone else who would like to make opening comments to please raise their hands. Got OA, NAN, rewable northwest. Anyone else? Great, thank you. Okay, let's go ahead and get started with OsEA and then we'll move down the line. Good morning, Jack. Good morning. Chair Decker and Commissioner Tani. For the record, my name is Jack Watson. I'm the director of policy and regulatory affairs for the Oregon Solar and Storage Industries association. I'd like to begin by thanking staff for their efforts to prepare this report. There have been several areas that have substantially improved since the start of the docket. However, there are several remaining issues that need further resolution prior to this RFP going to market. The main issue for OA is the affiliates ability to participate in the 2023 RFP. While staff recommend some additional requirements on the affiliates participation, OA does not feel that there are sufficient safeguards to address the negative impacts on competition and fairness in the competitive bidding process. Another issue is that some of the contract provisions in the form contract, specifically the right of first offer on finance bids, are potentially problematic. Our members have indicated that this provision is particularly difficult for bids that are being financed, as it places an especially onerous burden on the bidder that may make financing impossible. OA recommends the section be removed from the form contract. Lastly, in miscellaneous considerations, OA recommends that staff statements on suggesting changes to the RFP schedule due to the changes from LC 80 and uM 2273 decision be expanded to reflect changes to the BPA, TSP and TC 25, as both of these BPA processes have significant implications on bid viability and could materially alter bid abilities to meet the necessary commercial operation dates. Thank you for the opportunity to comment and I remain on to answer any commissioner questions. Thank you. Any questions at this time for Oseia. Appreciate you highlighting some of your biggest issues, and we'll let you know if we have any further questions as we move along. All right, let's go to Jake Stevens with new sun. Good morning, Chair Decker. Commissioner Tani, thank you for the opportunity to comment this morning. I hope you've read our comments, especially the most recent ones. And I'd like to both comment on the high level issues and framing here, as well as some specific solutions. And hopefully you'll provide some time to follow up on some of the questions that Commissioner Tani, for example, and you asked earlier, checkr at a macro level, I remain pretty concerned about the state of affairs, and I want to, although I feel it's uncomfortable, encourage you to zoom out and look at where is the state of Oregon at this point. We have a statutory standard that requires that the ownership of resources be diverse. We have a track record which is essentially that PGE, or one specific IPP, that is split assets with them to get a 50 50 or something bill transfer plus PPA deal have won and speak for the results of all of the RFPs for, I guess, a decade plus now. And my memorian goes back so far to Cardi or so. But essentially, if the IOU is winning every single outcome or splitting single assets, that's not diverse, it doesn't meet the statutory standard and it points to a broken system. Like we have these competitive rules. Ultimately, in order to ensure diversity, options are put to the market, that we have a healthy market, the rateayers have access to a healthy market, and so that companies like ourselves, the members of Nipsey, members of USIA, et cetera, can actually invest in a fair marketplace where it's worthwhile. And I find myself faced with a basic question right now, as somebody who can wee power from central Oregon to Seattle to midsea or to Portland. And candidly, just to put this in context, I have 700 transmission to Portland system, period. That's the number in the staff report on the first page. And I don't know why I should bother to do business with Portland General or continue to invest resources and bidding in this process, because it is candidly not fair, has not been reliable. When we bid a project, we put it into exclusivity for a long period of time. We can't do business with other people. And there's a lot of people in the market now. There's",

        "text": " try to correct it in our, in some responsive comments that we will file. All right, thank you. Any questions for Miss schooover? Okay, anyone else want to offer comments on these two issues, the length of the interconnection agreement or the deposit amounts and timing? Algh seeing none, we'll go to, we're going to open this up for other comments beyond those that were the issues that we had specifically listed in our agenda. And I'm going to go back to Greg Adams first to talk about the ten megawatt capacity eligibility measurement. Yes, thank you, Judge Owin. So this is another section of the rules that's getting revised year, or was. And so, so in our view, is within the scope, it's the question of applicability of the rules. And so our recommendation is that the proposed rule be revised to clarify that the applicability. And again, so this is in subsection 0005, sub one. And so our proposal is that this should clarify that the ten megawatt cap capacity measurement for purposes of eligibility to use these small generator interconnection rules should be consistent with the ten megawatt capacity measurement for eligibility to the small qualifying facility standard contract in the Commission's rules in division 29, which were just adopted, which is to measure the capacity of the whole facility at the point of interconnection and not to sum the cap capacity of the individual components. This proposal would modernize the rules for newer technologies like solar co located with battery energy storage that don't easily conform to kind of a traditional nameplate capacity framework. And it would also encourage, rather than discourage the co location of batteries or other storage by removing the possibility of rendering the project ineligible for use of the small generator rules when it adds a storage device, that doesn't increase the export capacity of the overall system. So we understand that staff may have intended this result with the latest version of the proposed rule, but as we explained in our comments, we don't think that the language in the proposed rule quite accomplishes the objective we're trying to see accomplished. Because it uses the word sums, it says that you have to sum the capacity of the storage and the solar capacity. So the changes that are proposed to the rule are positive in one regarding that they from our perspective and that they clarify, we're measuring ac capacity at an inverter for an inverter based system, but it still could be read to some that cap capacity of that solar plus a storage, and depending on where the storage is located, it's not even entirely clearing how it would work the way it's currently written. So our proposal is to have it either use the word export capacity in the applicability section, or to use language that's really just the same as what's in the division 29 rules for purposes of eligibility there. All right, any questions for Mister Adams on those additional comments? All right, seeing none. Thank you. Mister Adams. Does anyone else have comments concerning other parts of the rules or the rules generally beyond those that we listed as a part of the agenda today? Yes, Miss Schoonover, thank you. Judge Alwine. In our written comments that we filed on Friday, we identified some minor revisions to the rules and would just direct you to those. I think that they are pretty self explanatory, but'be happy to answer any questions about those. I'd also like to respond to the applicability issue and I'll keep it brief because I don't want to repeat myself, but in our view, this is another issue that's outside the scope, has not been thoroughly discussed, and would oppose changing it to export capacity right now. I think that the implications of that maybe broader than then it could be broader. I think it justts warrants more discussion. We, we, you know, we did add the reference to the inverter to the definition of nameplay rating in an effort to address storage. And we think that one challenge with using export capacity is that the way you determine a facility's export capacity is, is if it's limited by an acceptable export control method. And that's all detailed in a new rule. And it's quite technical. I will freely admit to not understanding all of that myself. I think that it could be problematic if the eligibility to simply apply and proceed under these rules is dependent upon technical review to determine if you really have the right export limitations to be less than 10 mw export capacity, especially given that the export controls concept is new in Oregon's ruls. And we're all going to have to figure out how that works. So I think absent, we would be willing to further discuss this issue in a future informal phase of this docket, but would oppose making that change at this juncture. Thank you. All right, thank you very much. Any questions for the joint utilities? All right, mister Zakai from IR Rec, thank you. Good afternoon again. I just have one last thing to say, which is that I reviewed the, you know, the",

        "text": " conditions that are set up around the affiliate to hold customers harmless, which I think speak to some of the concerns that some stakeholders have presented in this RFP docket, which you're also addressing in the affiliate docket. To your question about how the affiliate would be treated like a benchmark, I think just a level set. We need to just clarify just some terms about what bids would be considered benchmark. And I think for that purpose we're saying anything that PG or PRR works with a IPP to develop a bid that would be considered kind of like a PG sponsored bid or something that would be treated like a benchmark. But if a third party was to bid in some sort of solar BTA option, that's not considered to be treated like a benchmark, just to make sure that there's a distinction between how those would be presented, but they would both take advantage of the affiliate vehicle in terms of what where would I was not going to, sorry, if I understood you to'be just defining sort of what's a utility owned proposal coming from the market and what's a benchmark bid. If you were meaning to say something about how the affiliate fits into that, I did not catch it. I was just trying to draw the line of what is considered what affiliate bid would be treated like a benchmark. Yeah. Was that were there? Yeah. My question is, is anything that an affiliate is involved in going to be treated in the first category that you described the benchmark from a process perspective in the RFP? And if not, what are the differences? Yeah, thank you. And y. Sorry, maybe I'm not answering that clearly you so I'll try to say it again differently, but all I meant to say was that if PG or PR works with an IPP to submit a bid that would be considered PG sponsor bid, that would be treated like a benchmark. Therefore it would be scored with the benchmark bids. Before we open any third party bid, we would disclose whether we'd be using any sort of PG owned or procured asset and whether or not those be made available too, all bidders. But if the affiliate was, I mean, I guess I thought you were basically the position that's been taken is anytime an affiliate touches something, even if it's working with an IPP, not with the benchmark team or whatever, that a protection that some confnors have said we should adopt is that those should be treated from a process perspective like the benchmark bids. I thought in your comments you said, well, we'll accept that up to a certain point and I'm just trying to understand what that point is. But what I hear you saying here is that no aniate, whether an affiliates involved or not doesn wouldn't make a difference to which of these categories something goes in. It's late so I'm going to not be making sense. But I guess my point is I want to make sure that we have clarity about what you are offering to do in response to those concerns. So if you're saying yes, we'll, in response to those concerns treat a bid in affiliate is involved in with sort of that higher level of scrutiny that's required of a benchmark resource. I want that to be very clear. And, and where there are sort of exceptions to that, I want to understand what those are going forward. We don't have to do it right now. Okay, thanks. Yeah. And I will let the two hands that are up respond to the things I just brought up. But we got to be done here at four, so please be very brief. Let's go to Jake and then to ire in. Thanks. Ched Decr on the labor question, the contract should say comply with the law, period. That's our obligation to do that. We don't need extra criteria or convoluted language around that. And labor will be a real challenge in Oregon's decarbonization that needs to be left flexible to solve, including an accommodation with future changes to the law, which the neutral language of comply with the law will cover. It shouldn't be drafted. This was an issue in the bids that we brought up on the this general affiliates opportunity. The Portland has outlined that they need, what, four gigs or so of stuff plus transmission plus storage. So they've got like five or $10 billion of potential rate basing opportunities lined out. I think the biggest exposure to decarbonization for IOU execution on this is abuse of these processes for the rfps and the IRP. Clean energy plans to self deal and write programs that allow them to g game the process. Portland General's fact pattern for the last couple rfps is not favorable. Portland general and Nexterra split all of the outcomes in terms of affiliate bids and so forth. They should be absolutely treated as benchmark. Or more realistically, you should be looking at prohibiting those affiliate bids at all, which would be our recommendation. Understand your perspective.

        "text": " I do think that change needs to be made here. If you want to actually see the potential benefits of those resources that are more established, come online and come up with a plan that is more, I would say, reasonable and achievable based on the actual information that we have today. So yes to that piece, in terms of the tension between the cost assumptions and the modeling and the costs that are actually coming in through bids, it's definitely a fair observation. I think in the planning context, what we would really like to see in order to determine whether the plan appears reasonable or not is some more analytical justification of those cost increases as opposed to we looked at the market and put our thumb on the scale. That's not super reassuring. And it would be interesting, I guess to see whether that change produces other material changes in the plan that could then go on to have downstream influence on the RFP. I can't say for sure that it would all I can say for sure is that the explanation that we've received to date does not inspire confidence in us. Okay, thanks. All right, we got to move on. Never fear, we'll get to you Pacific court. But we have at least one more written commoner Sierra club that hasn't had a chance to speak yet. So Rose, good afternoon. Thanks for your patience. Yeah, thank you, chair Decker. And good afternoon, Commissioner Tawi. I will try to keep this brief and not repeat what we've heard today. A couple points I did want to raise. I know we've talked a lot about the pausing of the 2022 all source RFP, but I think this really does get to points going back to what Cub was saying earlier, the disconnect between what's happening in a planning exercise and what's happening in the real world. I just think that we are not seeing a movement in the real world as quickly and is with as much urgency as we know is needed. It's not just from an emissions reductions perspective, quite honestly, but also an economic perspective. Moving forward with clean energy procurement is good for Oregon. It's good for Utah, it's good for Wyoming, it's good for the entire system. And so we have major concerns with pausing of the Ulcers RP and quite frankly, we would urge the commission to order the company to move forward with that. Which sort of goes to what should we do about the update information that we're waiting for since that pause happened without any of that analysis being done beforehand, do we wait for an acknowledgement until June? And I'm also have been reflecting on that question today and we will have to give it more thought. But I do wonder if there is maybe a preliminary order or preliminary direction that could be given in the short term before a full decision was made later because there are a lot of issues in the IRP and CEP that I think could be acted on within the current timeframe. But then briefly, I just want to also raise some other points that cr our club raised in comments. And again, this really goes to thec Civicorp system planning because the faster that theic corp moves its entire system towards decarbonization, the less it has to be done specifically for Oregon. And so we urge the commissioners to keep digging into that. We flagged, for instance, whether the company is capitalizing upon opportunities under the Inflation Reduction Act. A really big one that I'm just going to highlight, which is'on our comments, is the energy infrastructure reinvestment program. It's a loan program from DoE that can be used for energy projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Our analysis found that reduces costs system wide by billions of dollars. So again, it's a win win for Oregon and all the other states. But I wanted to give an update on that analysis that after we had submitted those comments, we had an opportunity to meet with DoE, and I just wanted to update the commission that in our comments, we estimated that savings could be in the realm of 20 billion. And after talking to DoE, we realized that our estimates were a little high. But we did recalculate it, and the estimated savings is still upwards of 13 billion. Do so. It's still a lot of money. So I went on to flag that for the commission, and I'm sure we'll elaborate on that in future comments. And I'm happy to answer any questions that the commissioner has had about our comments today. Commissioner Tawi, anything you want to follow up on? And Ro, appreciate the thoughtful reaction to the schedule idea and look forward to continued engagement. I think your understanding of the loan, the reinvestment loan, is there sort of a ticking clock on that, that sort of where it has to be taken advantage of in a certain timef frame? Yes, it has to be taken advantage of by September 2026. And so we really did see this IRP as being an important opportunity to look at it. We're not totally out",

        "text": " provide parties with information about what avoided costs would look like based on the assumptions and inputs that PGE has used in the IRP, which you know, inevitably feeds into these avoided costs. And PGE has responded in the IRP context, that they interpret this to provision to mean that we need to go dig through all of their work, paapers in the IRP, to find all of the inputs that would go into their model. And that's an incredible burden to put on stakeholders. And then inevitably, when they do file their avoided costs, that same rule provides that the avoided costs will become effective 30 days after filing. And so once we do get full transparency into what inputs PGE is putting, where it's on a very tight timeline and hard to dig in. And I appreciate the commission and staff's recommendation that the commission adopted in this case to provide a little bit more time for parties to look at these issues and dig in. But it still leaves us, you know, kind of in the same place where it's a lot of information to dig into in a short amount of time. And it would be extremely helpful if the commission could send a message to PGE that they need to file that draft avoided cost information when they file the IRP, so that it gives everybody a little bit more time and information to dig in. So that's the main process concern. And I know, you know, there's obviously a lot going into, um 2000, but if we're going to be sticking with the status quo as we move forward, then, you know, we don't know when um 2000 is going to be resolved. So it would be great to be able to make some progress now to move forward. And if I. Sorry, just add one quick comment. In terms of having an environment to invest in, we still are in a framework, and where there are projects we could actually present as qfs to PGE and other Oregon utilities. But it's a pretty discouraging investment environment related to this. And I want to point out one other technical issue on the battery assumptions. You know, in terms of. I think there were some attempts by Mister Gibbons to sort of contemplate some of the charging dynamics of the batteries, which I definitely think merits further investigation. But I would probably surmise that batteries that are charging from the grid should be charging in a manner that matches the Lolps, which should be matching the peaks in the market, which last year included $1,000 megawatt hour and overnight prices that were quite substantial. August forwardd price curves have been bumping up against dollar 200 megawatt hour for the last couple of years and look to be in that neighborhood, for example. So it's not clear it would be counterintuitive based on what we're seeing here to assume, you know, maybe they're spreading the charging around all year as opposed to concentrating it in those periods. Of course, we haven't been able to examine that more closely, but it seems just vastly out of line with what seems to be going on in the market and the pricing. Thank you. Okay, questions for nun. And I'll just, I guess, in the v. And I guess this would go to the other folks who have commented. We're in, obviously, in a capacity constrained environment in terms of staff capacity at the PUC, and we're also moving through a very complicated docket, um 2000, that is likely to address many of these issues. Don't know what it'll look like when it comes out the other end, but given that staff restraint and capacity and the time it would take to dive in deeper on some of these issues, how do you weigh that in your expectation that we make progress at this particular point in time versus moving forward with uM 2000? Because really, anything that we devote time to right now on this particular case is going to affect capacity for working on other issues. And so it's this dynamic of trying to deal with an issue, but also recognizing the constraints around it. And so I guess I would put that to Jake and the others. How do you balance that when you're looking at issue? It's going to affect how long that these new rates come into effect, and then it's also potentially going to affect how long it takes us to get through um 2000, which will then, of course, affect rates on the other end. So I guess I would ask you that question. Yeah, thank you. And I appreciate the question and the spirit of it. You know, I think one of our big concerns throughout a number of dockets is the pattern of behavior of the ious'presenting, information that we're unable to properly examine or challenge or is demonstrably false, or in this case, for example, unilaterally asserting some discretion that puts all of us in an awkward position. Like, they've just decided that batteries cost this and it's going",

        "text": " market price payments consistent with, like settled index prices in addition to fixed capacity payments. I think we think that that's consistent with. For policy in this space. And I think that's the most direct and demonstrable way to show that these energy deliveries tie out with the utilities of what it cost. So just while we were talking about this space, I wanted to share PG's thinking on that issue. And I think you'll see that in our comments throughout this proceeding. Well, that sounds excellent. Thank you so much. Yeah. Okay. So far it sounds as though we have a lot of. We've had a lot of great discussion. I think, you know, these issues at least identified and that we're proposing to address that know these are the right issues and, and we will fine tune the exact ideal path forward. Appreciate all the discussion so far, Jake. Yeah, thanks. As I mentioned earlier, like, for the size, eligibility and pricing term, I think there needs to be a. A standard rate and contract available to 20 for the 20 megawatt and stuff. And then standard being available all the way to 80. And then pricing term, I think should be probably extended to 25 years or not less than that which is being contemplated and considered in the rfps in all cases. So the thing we want to avoid there is that there's a 30 year RFP bid that's taking 30 year debt, which is lower, just like it would be for your home mortgage. Right. And that somehow becomes the basis of the avoided cost pricing. But then the QF doesn't have a right to the same fixed price term to finance against. And given, I think, the RFP minimum term lengths and maximum eligible lengths are pushing towards longer and longer terms, you know, here and throughout the industry. So that should be on the agenda. The next slide, I had a comment on you in terms of the capacity resource. The. I mean, this is an interesting question obviously in a lot of procurement right now is focused on, you know, four hour batteries. Right. But the reality is obviously that much longer duration is going to be necessary. And so not sure that, you know, just a four hour battery, for example, is the right resource. The question of what the length of that is is a big question. And then I think we've seen recently the Pacific or put nuclear power plants and their IRP for like 2031 and two, I haven't seen where that's in the current updated model. But ultimately that was, those are extremely costly resources and if those are going to be part of the resource plan, we should be also thinking about what happens if the utility specifies something like that. Very fair points to raise. Yeah, I appreciate that. And then I guess I haven't seen in Oregon, but there's other markets where black start capabilities like as an avoided cost if the grid goes down AB to restart things has value. And especially you, least one or two of the utilities have some pretty small service territories there that might be relevant. So looking at how that might be compensated to protect people in the event of outages and so forth. Jake, is, is black star capability considered an ancillary service? Yes, I think that's right. Yeah. And I guess ancillary service is another question. But yeah, again, it can be hard to bring grids back up and it was not uncommon in other places or other points in time with QF projects in the past. So it's worth exploring. And then again, related to all this, like, you know, what are the fines and penalties, exposures? You know, what extra is going to be paid, for example, to buy carbon credits or other things in the market in 2030. I think we have to presume that the standard that is trying to be avoided is to avoid not being compliant with the law in 2030 as it relates achieving those things. So that should be something we're looking at too, in terms of how we're going to price. That sounds good. Sounds very good. Thank you, Jake. Then Andres. Yeah, just want to add for this black star into that bar. They are NERC standards of what is required for NR for a black star. And current inverters are not capable of that part. You have to get a special inverter that is a grid forming and has some kind of storage that can start it from that part. So unless we start requiring customers to have a storage and never use it, so it's available for Black Star, this is going to be a complicated one to get because then we'll have to show to NRC how is our black c capability? Just that is part of a standard from Nerk. So there's no a whole lot of wiggle room into there. You just have to follow all those neare rules. And for that part, and that's totally fair, I think",

        "text": " stepping into the middle of a longer conversation, but was there any, was there any consideration of other qualifying renewables paired with storage, as would they fall under this category or would that need to be, be handled differently? So we're not opposed to having any of those, and we could certainly develop a price specific to any QF that came to us. But we don't have a standard rate for anything other than the defined storage resource. So the proposal here is to make sure we have a standard rate to make it extra easy to have an up to three megawatt solar and storage resource. But for other things, we would develop a nonstandard calculation using the commission methodology. Thank you. So stepping back to the filing, there's one additional calculation here. You know, we're using our 21 IRP proxy wind resource peak value and the off peak value, and it's spreading the annual costs of the proxy renewable to the different time periods. Same thing is done for the premium peak and the solar and storage off peak. The ratios are a little different. The proportion of the day is different. The premium peak is like 4 hours per day versus 16 hours per day for the on peak. So these numbers look a little different, but it's the same idea, spreading dollars to the premium peak period and dollars to the off peak period. And that showed back up over here. You know, these are the same numbers calculated for the premium peak in the off peak. So how did we get that? Let me pull that one up for everyone. Dan, are these numbers here? This is before you add capacity, this is energy only how it's shifting between peak and off peak, is that right? It's the avoided cost of the proxy resource, which includes some embedded capacity based on the contribution of the proxy resource. But there is an adjustment for capacity after that. Ok, and we can step through that again. Here we go. So this is the Excel file. And I presume when we send everybody the Excel file for the EIM one, we'll send this one as well, which shows the calculations that we were looking at in the PDF of the filing. But like I said, we're pulling in the, spreading the cost of the renewable wind resource into premium peak and off peak periods and then adding the capacity and so on. So let's see here. I mean, one of the first questions is what is the capacity contribution of the proxy resource? And we have that somewhere here. It's a 61% contribution. And actually you can see in the other file, we have a calculation in this EAM file that also includes the LOLP and it shows what the capacity contribution of the Sol and storage resource would be relative to the loss of load event hours. And we just calculate how many of the loss of load event hours the solar storage resource was available during. It's quite a bit higher than the solar only resource. It's not as much as a battery. If our battery in our 2021 IRP was about a 77% contribution. Part of that is there's not enough solar generation to fill up the battery completely in the winter months, so there isn't 4 hours worth of output. So there's a little bit of loss there. And there's also, as you can see, some of the loss of load events are outside of the four hour period because they're spread across the rest of the day. A forward battery couldn't necessarily cover 7 hours or 8 hours of events, but these events don't all happen in the same day. This is the sum of a bunch of stochastic analysis. And so there may have been a three hour event in the middle of the night, and then some number of events here and some other events. These are all overlapping. So when we go back and look at the individual outages, how much could a four hour battery cover if it started dispatching when the outage occurred, as opposed to trying to cover just a particular time period? So the ability to shift a battery around in the day and use it when it's needed provides extra value. But is it close? 77% for a four hour storage resource under our control, versus 61% for just picking 4 hours. It's capturing much, most of the possible events for a four hour period. So not a terrible representation of capturing value from capacity. Any questions about that? Dan, just to clarify, the proxy resource itself was solar plus storage. So we've calculated a solar plus storage profile for a sort of example, QF version of solar and storage. So how could that resource perform in the avoided cost calculation? The proxy resource is a wind resource. We have in each of our QF avoid cost rates, we have a sample profile for baseload and wind and solar and so on. And so we have a sample solar and storage profile that we've calculated here. And so then maybe just at a high level, can you just explain then the relationship",

        "text": " the battery to that facility. And then we've got additional 755 or so megawatts where we're in advanced contract negotiations. And that pathway is further supported by the outcomes in our most recent IRP update, where we've identified the need for additional battery capacity here in the near York term. That timing on years may not perfectly line up with that, but what we saw as a result of those developments last year in the RFP, where we thought it would lead us, has turned out to be supported by what we're showing in the IRP update portfolio. And I will note that, you know, so it's clear wildfire risk and liability does require Pacificorp to manage our cash flow on a day to day basis, which means, you know, we've got limited capital and money needed for new transmission and new resources is constrained, and that can certainly have some adverse impacts. A lot of the conversation we've been having as it relates to reliability over time. So we're aware of that. We're monitoring it. We're accounting for it in our resource procurement decisions that we're planning for and making. And I think this is the space where, if I could, if I can confirm Nikki is still available, where I'd like to kind of give her an opportunity, Niki K. Cooblia, to maybe get into a little more details around that, comments around financial stability as it relates to the wildfire risk liability. So, Nikki, are you available? Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks, Rick. Chair Decker, nice you again. Commissioner Tani. Commissioner Perkins. We haven't met, but I'm Nikki Kabilia. I'm the CFO here at Pacific Corp. So, you know, Rick, of course, mentioned that we are currently in this situation where we're managing our cash on a daily basis. That, of course, includes management of our operating expenses. But more important, taking really a hard look at our capital expenditures over the next several years. You know, the detailed review is a result of those wildfire liabilities that were mentioned that we are managing every day. We also had credit ratings downgrades that I believe you're all aware of in June and November of 2023. If we see a further downgrade that could severely limit our ability to all funds, as we would expect, not as many investors may be interested in supporting the company. And one of the key takeaways we had from the ratings downgrade is the need to maintain our various credit metrics. In particular, you hear this one, funds from operations to debt, Fota debt. I have it in lots of places. When you look at testimony for cases, that ratio is really about your cash management and where we borrow more, that weakens the metric. The primary reason we borrow is to fund those capital expenditures. With that constraint on that metric and the pressure from wildfire liability settlements, which is also a draw on the cash. As I noted, we're reviewing all of our capital expenditures to find places where we can either cancel or delay spending and then prioritizing the items that remain. As you look at the prioritization might be what you expect. Wildfire mitigation projects that we have out there, maintenance of the existing fleets, new customer connects as they come up. Large transmission and generation projects where we were already fully committed. So Rick alluded to some of those various projects that already in flight. Those are still happening, but it likely means that we're not going to be able to build and own incremental new generation resources for the next few years. To the extent that we need new resources, our likely path is going to be purchase power agreements, as those contracts don't require us to fund the construction of the facility and therefore they don't have as much of an impact on our credit metrics to the effect that there are capacity contracts. There is an impact, but it's not nearly as impactful as owning and borrowing for those resources. So I just wanted to give a little flavor of that. Happy to answer any more questions or anything about that. Again, I know we've, we've discussed this in various places, but Happ. Happy to do it. Again. Thanks, Nikki and Rick and I appreciate you being upfront in this forum about this issue. I think many PC watchers will sort of wonder what you know about why we're talking about this year because the normal place where we would and presumably are testing these types of issues is usually our contested RA cases and things. But what I see happening is for those who aren't involved in those contested cases, sort of a real disconnect between the plans and what they say the company should do based on long term analysis and what the company is actually doing that without some explanation is pretty hard to understand. I don't know that. Again, I think it's difficult, important but difficult to have you explaining this in this environment because isn't we're having to think through what the relevance to these kinds of planning environments is of the kinds of financial considerations that you're talking about. But the whole",

        "text": ", the issues that you felt were still open in terms of the. The partyies still having different perspectives on them. Were the issue related to the cost of imputed debt and then this RFP condition seven. So I guess my perspective, just for purposes of setting up public comment here, is that the commission we commissioners discussed the first of those two issues at some length on May 16. And I'm not particularly interested in a lot more dialogue on those. In the effort to use the time that we have today to get to resolution of whatever new issues there are. Obviously can't control what anyone says. Or if my colleagues disagree with that and want more on that, they can ask questions on that themselves. But just put that out there. Okay. You're going to move on, I think, to the new material. That's right. Thank you, chair Deckeer. So, as you alluded to chair Decker, due to scheduling oversight by staff, the May report did not have the benefit of a lot of additional insights. From the IE's second report on the RFP. So to incorporate some additional recommendations from the IE, staff produced a supplemental report containing twelve additional conditions. In reply comments to staff's supplemental report. Idaho Power has agreed to adopt most of those supplemental conditions. I believe there are only three that I think are sort of somewhat outstanding. I'm prepared to describe all of the conditions from the supplemental report, if you would like. Or in the interest of time, I'm prepared to just move on to the three that I think are sort of somewhat out standing. I'd prefer that unless someone. Yeah, I prefer. Focus on what's outstanding. Absolutely. Thank you. So for three of staff, supplemental conditions Idaho Power had offered alternative solutions that tried to address staff and stakeholder concerns and which staff understands, based on Nipsey's reply comments which were filed late yesterday, that we believe that these alternative solutions that were proposed by Idaho Power are acceptable to Nipsey and would therefore be acceptable to staff. So the three issues I think that are sort of outstanding are supplemental condition five, which dealt with delay damages supplemental condition seven on the limitation of Idaho power transmission liability, and supplemental condition eleven on charging management for battery energy storage systems. Staff believes that IPC's proposed solutions adequately resolve these issues and again, assuming their acceptability to stakeholders, could be adopted by the commission. Regarding condition five on delay damages, staff recommended reducing the dollar figure contained in the form contract for delay damages. Instead, Idaho Power recommended leaving the dollar figure in that form contract as sort of a bracketed blank and would therefore be, you know, fully subject to commercial negotiations between bidders and the company and staff thinks that that's an acceptable solution. And my understanding is that NIpsey also found that that was an acceptable solution. Condition seven addressed limit limitations on Idaho powers liability for delays caused by its interconnection department. Staff recommended deleting several contractual provisions that were identified by Nipsey as being problematic. In reply comments, Idaho Power instead made some more targeted revisions to just remove specific language from those contractual provisions. And again, staff's understanding is that Idaho powers edits have addressed Nipsey's concerns, at least sort of in this discrete case. I believe that they have sort of some more broad concerns, but I think that this addressed their concern. And on that basis, you know, staff would find that as an acceptable solution as well. And finally, on supplemental condition seven dealt with charging management for battery energy storage systems. Staff had recommended language on charge and discharge instructions based on some of the concerns that were raised by Nipsey. Idaho Power did not agree to this condition, but it did note in its reply comments that the operating parameters for battery systems will be subject to negotiation and based on technical specifications that are provided by bidders, and the section for those where those technical specifications would be included in the form contractor currently left blank. In an appendix to the battery storage agreement, and in its own reply comments, Nipsey indicated that while it was supportive of staff's condition regarding battery charge and discharge instructions, it also found that IPC's reply was satisfactory and addressed their concerns. And assuming that that's the case, and obviously Nipsey can speak for themselves, but I think if they are satisfied with IPC's response there, then staff would be prepared to withdraw that condition. Okay. Yeah, no's, that's helpful. Is that that, should we go to any questions about that set of four that you just discussed or was there more that you wanted to say before we. I have questions, sorry, I have a few other comments on sort of some other issues that staff did not choose to make recommendations on. But I think that this would absolutely be anropriiate place to pause. Okay. I think one of my overall questions and I appreciate the constructive engagement and, you know, finding. Sorry, I. For my notes, resolution is great. I find",

Joining me today from staff are Caroline Moore, Scott Gibbons, Charles Lockwood, and staff counsel Stephanie Andrews. If you are just joining or have not done so already, please take a moment to introduce yourself in the chat, sharing your name and the organization that you represent. Actually, we might actually take a minute or two to have introductions hereologies. Here we are'll do a brief around the horn. Again, we're using the same operating agreements as prior workshops. Please remain on mute unless you are speaking, and except during this whole intro period, please feel free to ask questions in the chat. And if you'd like to voice your question or comment, take a moment now to familiarize yourself with the raise your hand feature on Zoom. And lastly, please be respectful of all participants in the workshop. That being said, we're going to get into the agenda here. We have a focus agenda today. We'll start with introductions here and then we'll use approximately half an hour to give an overview of staff's goals in creating its phase I proposal this, as well as giving a brief overview of the proposal itself. Then we'll have a small break as needed in return to you the remainder of our time for open discussion of individual proposal issue elements in the field and understand your comments quest for clarification and alternatives, and we'll conclude with the next steps and discussion of how we move forward. So with that, introduce myself and who is on for staff today? If parties would like to give an introduction and let us know who we have online, please just give us a quick state your name and who you're with. Hey, thanks. Ryan Zachragala with Pacor. Here with me we have Jocelyn Peas with Mrg, Jim Schroeder, Jennifer Angel, Tom Burns, Ron Shierr, Iber Medras, Dan McNeil, Paul Johnson. I believe that's it from PAC. We'll drop names in the chat, brothers join after that, but happy to be here. Thanks. Hi, Ryan, this is Adam Lowy.

Abby Johnson is here, Allison Williams, Andres Valipnia, Camille Kristen, Donovan Walker, Megan Guia, Shelby Mc Ney, and I think that is everybody. Like Zach said, we've got quite a few folks, so others join. They may be joining a little bit later. Thanks. Oh, you're on mute, Chris. Sorry, Chris pleasant with PGE and I have Jimmy Lindsay and Jordan schooover also representing PGE today. Thank you. This is Iren Sanger and Ellie Hardwick, both appearing for Northwest Intermountain Power Producers Coalition and the Renewable Energy Coalition. Hi, this is Greg Adams. I'm here for Korea today. Hi, it's Jack Watson. I'm here on the behalf of Osia. Yeah, Jake Stevens here for n Sun Energy. And I think Richard Lorenz may be on the line somewhere or joining at some point as well for n Sun. Thanks. All right, thank you so much, everyone. It's nice to see you all today. I think we'll jump right into it at this point. Just a reminder of where we are here. Presented as the original outlay of the phase process for um 2000 resolution, we're currently underway in phase one, we're gonna find resolution where we can and to create a targeted list of issues for resolution in the contested case phasei. So, as promised here, getting right into its staff's goals in preparing its phase one proposal for resolution of identified issues or overall to develop a process of betterigns and and signal system needs. This includes incorporating reliability needs during system resource transition and recognizing transmission requirements for new resources. Our goal of better signaling system needs also means aligning our process with changing resource procurement drivers such as HB 2021 versus the renewable portfolio standard, incorporating the small scale resource requirements, better aligning system value with realistic avoided resource characteristics, potentially leveraging data for more frequent and nimble rfps that we recognize are likely to be in our future, I would say. Lastly, staff's proposal seeks to strike a balance between precision and simplicity in order to increase transparency and confidence in avoided costs, recognizing that these enhancements reflect the value of Purpa project projects and the modern environment cannot be done without consideration for customer affordability and administrative feasibility as well. With those goals in mind, we first sought to update the price streams available to reflect the post HB 2021 environment moving into the future. To that end, we propose eliminating the renewable and non renewable distinctions, adding a class for resources paired with energy storage based on the existing interim solar plus storage rate, and in following staff uM 2011 best practices, we propose establishing solar",

        "text": " that we've heard, but I, you know, one of the main topics that I've been wrestling with, because this idea of two different rates, one that can be where the peak hours to be changed and one where it's not. And I just would much prefer a construct where the peak hours can be matched to what the utility actually needs. And I think if we set that structure upfront, then the rates that are set can follow that and be appropriate. And also QF developers who want to get in the game and take advantage of this option, we'll have all the information that know that they can have at that time to make their investment decisions. I just don't feel compelled to come up with a structure that matches every potential project out there. And so I think, you know, the developers are going to have some risk when they get into this game. But I don't think that this is a very big risk and I could be wrong, but I tend to think about the shift kind of the way Jimmy from PGE mentioned it as well. I think if suddenly the peak hours were in the midday when the sun is shining, I would think that's only a windfall to a developer. That'easier to take advantage of that and they can still dispatch their batteries in off hours. But if I'm wrong about that, I don't think that matters. I think as long as we're clear about the construct, then people can make informed business decisions about whether or not they want to get in that in the game. But I do think it's a pretty reasonable construct that staff has come forward with. I supportive of the 50 megawatt hour cap and actually all the other aspects of what staff proposing here. I'm also supportive of what staff'proposing I see real challenges around Idaho Power'suggestion around three price streams for different technology options. What staff articulated here is an overarching sort of value for production and then a lot of space for the Purpa party to craft the technical solution on their side of the interconnection to maximize their opportunity for profit. Particularly the four to one solar to battery option lets them decide how much do they want to try to charge the battery and also produce for the interconnection if there is a reason to do that in the middle of the day. I think looking at all of the trends in the WACC, it its quite unlikely that thats where things will land should they land there. Theyve got the information, as Commissioner Thompson pointed out, to make their business decision as they see fit. So I think staff created a lot of flexibility for the Purpa parties and allowed the utilities then to shape that output to some degree to went to when the customers really need it. And I think that'a good balance without contravening the guidance of Purpa to allow and encourage new technology to come in into the marketplace, as Marie pointed out. So I'm comfortable supporting staff's recommendation. Great. Then it sounds like we are all comfortable supporting staff's recommendation. I think this ISRT an example of a place where, as parties have described, there was a lot of good collaboration that got us to this point. There are some things that people would like to see differently here. I think they're somewhat offsetting. You have the flexibility around storage design and that's offset with the hours change. I think at the 50 megawatt point we're really going to want to see if that flexibility in design led to a systematic over compensation of capacity for a particular resource design or something. I think with the hours changing over the course of the contract, I think we have to be looking for places where purple resources can be more flexible to add value to the system throughout their term. I don't see the pricing changing. I don't think there's a legal problem here personally, but I guess I would point out that there's always the option to seek other forms of other price streams that the PUC has or non standard contract negotiations. I'm inclined to think that staff has struck a reasonable balance. I do take some comfort, I think, in the idea that both at the time of the compliance filing and at the time of the requested changes to the hours following irps, that there will be room for fact specific conversations and determinations. If, for instance, a developer that invested in a four hour battery or something felt like moving the capacity hours to the middle of the day meant that they weren't getting that incremental value relative to others whose solar is producing during that part of the day, I think there'll be arguments that way. Think given where the interconnection is going, I'd be surprised if the middle of the day is when the hours move to anyway. With all that said, it sounds like we'd be ready for emotion on Staffff's recommendation. We'move that we adopt status recommendation as set forth in the memo. I second that. I concur and bless you. Staff's recommendation is adopted. We'll look forward to seeing those compliance filings. I guess I want to",

        "text": "Good morning. Today's September 14, 2023, and we're here for a special public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission today. We are here to discuss PGE's integrated resource plan for 2023 and PGE's Clean Energy Plan for 2023. We have put an agenda out on the docket page and in an effort to keep things flexible and attuned to the situation that we find in the various different dockets, got a little bit of a different structure today. What we've done is outline in the agenda a list of parties who have filed written comments, recognizing that it is a partial list of those who have filed written comments. Those listed are ones that we know we have questions for, and we'll hope to take time to hear from additional participants who filed written comments as well. The way that we'll do this is by going through the list outlined in the agenda, asking those listed to give a short summary of their round one comments, and then likely move pretty quickly into commissioner questions. We would like to keep those summaries, as it says in the agenda, to three to five minutes so that we can move through the listed participants and hopefully get ono, some others as well. I want to just say by way of introduction here that this IRP and CEP, which, as I noted in our earlier workshop, are the first to be filed since the passage of HB 2021. The comments that have been filed here in round one of the commission's review are substantive. They're challenging, potentially could be described as overwhelming in number and breadth of issues that are covered in the comments. And what they do for me is really make the ambition of HB 2021 and the challenge in achieving all of its ambitions clear. They are, for me, a really good reminder of the value of the review process here at the PUC to surface lots of issues for robust discussion among parties and with the commission in that dialogue, there's a lot of learning, and ultimately for us, there is a necessary evaluation of trade offs in the amount of time that we have to emphasize areas of growth and improvement in modeling and accessibility, and a time for evaluation in trade offs in resource strategy as well. And I think what matters about this review process is the quality of the dialogue, both including the constructive and substantive nature of the comments that are filed and the degree to which the company, in this case PGE, responds with transparency and openness, along with a recognition of, again, those resource trade offs, both in modeling time in the IRP, in the resource strategy itself. Because there's so much here, we have decided again to follow a little bit different process with these workshops. As I said today, we're starting with an examination and exploration of staff and stakeholder comments from round one and we know that PGE has already filed written comments responding to those. But in order to be able to give those staff and stakeholder comments they'due in the workshop and not short shrift PGE's response to those, we have set aside some additional time and I think that's next Friday to really engage with PGE on the issues that were raised and their responses to those. Today we'll be seeking to really understand the most important parts of what staff and stakeholders are bringing forward and then we'll explore those more with PGE next Friday. All of that with an eye to ultimately understanding the decisions that are before us when we get to the point of making acknowledgement decisions. So that was a little bit of a longer introduction, but I think at least covers what we're doing today and my view of where we are in this process. I think maybe what I'll do is launch us right into the agenda and maybe invite my colleagues to think of any comments that they want to make on this process with their questions or at the end of the process with that, I am going to kick us off by inviting POUCC staff up to give a brief introduction to their comments, which again, we're robust and substantive and very much appreciated. And then when you're done with that brief overview, we'll go to commissioners for questions. Good morning and welcome. Sudashna good morning chair Deckar, Commissioners Toawi and Thomon. For the record, my name is Roadesh NPAl and I'm representing PUC staff. Today I'm joined by staff Council, our Raman Schneider and our independent consultant Elaine Hart. Staff congratulates and thanks PGE for taking up the challenge to create the first CEP ever filed with the commission. Staff is also grateful to stakeholders who devoted their time in reviewing PGE's plan and providing invaluable insights. As we know, HB 2021 has presented electric utility planning with new requirements and expectations regarding procurement of renewables and storage, reductions in the use of emitting resources, making space for community based renewable resources and emerging technologies, and evaluation of community impacts from utility actions. Regional resource adequacy programs and market developments have only added to these new sources of uncertainty and modeling challenges. The goal",

With those goals in mind, we first sought to update the price streams available to reflect the post HB 2021 environment moving into the future. To that end, we propose eliminating the renewable and non renewable distinctions, adding a class for resources paired with energy storage based on the existing interim solar plus storage rate, and in following staff uM 2011 best practices, we propose establishing solar, wind and baseload resource classes, with additional classes established where it can be demonstrated that a 5% difference in the LCC exists between a requ requested resource class and an existing one. We also propose all resource classes to allow eligibility for standard pricing for projects up to 10 mw in size, and we propose the use of independent and open source data for the development of QF proxy characteristic assumptions. Again, this is with the goal in mind of transparency and trust in the avoided costs developed, we can return to these slides for discussion. In updating the capacity evaluation methodology, staff proposes to capture a resources s capacity contribution over the life of the resource by moving away from a single snapshot year ELCC value. We propose eliminating the sufficiency and deficiency demarcation with a fixed rampant period per utility, and we propose moving toward a more realistic capacity resource that is not emitting and deliverable to Orego organ customers. For initial implementation, we might suggest this to be a wind resource. Staff proposes to align compensation with the role the resources anticipated to play in the utilities decarbonized system by using elastin ELCC tuned to a realistic and reliable system and as previewed, staff proposes to implement a pay as you go for the volumetric premium peak hour approach to signal hybrid resource dispatch during those times when it is most useful regarding energy valuation. Our proposals include eliminating the efficiency deficiency period mechanism here, utilizing the avoid proxies's energy value throughout the life of project, deriving avoided energy resource assumptions from actual utility procurements as available, and utilizing independent and open source data for QF proxy characteristic assumptions should that utility procurement data not be available. Oh, for the avoided capacity resource. Yes, I didn't misspeak, but I didn't need battery apologies. And then lastly lastly, we'll get into QF forecastings as well for policy compliance values and then, reflecting how these procurement drivers and system constraints affect our process, staff proposes to establish cost assumptions for the avoided resource reflecting its proportional share of transmission build out estimated in the IRP preferred portfolio. We also propose to establish a small scale resource compliance adder for projects 20 mw or less that attests to attaining SSR eligibility and for resources generating Rex staffoses to allow the QF to negotiate its own price for sale of those recs to the utility. Here are lastly, our proposal aims to update QF forecasting practices toward increased accuracy. Toward that end, we propose that utilities use ten years worth of historical renewal rate data of QF projects at the time of IRP filing and assume that QF will continue indefinitely upon reaching their current expiration date at a size equal to the historical renewal rate. This is a requirement replicated from Paxelc 82 if you want to see that additional detail how that works. Functionalized here, 60% of QF projects historically renew. Then the utility would then assume renewing qfs or qs upon reaching their current expiration dayate would renew at 60% of their capacity for all expiring qfs and then should ten years worth of historical data not be available, we propose using a flat assumption of 75% QF renewals and project success rates, and that is staff's overall goals. Do we have any questions on these or requests for clarification? Ryan, this is Adam Laudy. I just had a quick, if I heard you correctly, I think when you originally were describing the proxy resource that would be used for capacity, you had said wind, and I think you corrected yourself to say battery. And I just wanted to make sure I was tracking that. You did hear that correctly. Yes. Okay. I appreciate that, Adam. And I also had another question about, I think it was one of the proposals on maybe the slide right before this one, and that is the transmission build out under the policy. Yeah, there we go. The avoided deliverability issues. I was just hoping you could maybe speak a little more to exactly what that calculation would look like in staff's view and the rationale behind it. That is a good question. I mean, we are seeking to establish and avoided deliverability cost here and wanting to ground truth this in a process with good engagement, hence looking toward the IRP process. And I guess maybe is the idea. I mean, as I read it, what I'm seeing is you take, would you take every transmission project in the IRP and assume that every transmission project is going to be avoided",

I don't know if you had a chance to review this, but there's quite a bit of detail there that we look forward to working through with staff and the other stakeholders in the program you're looking at putting together. I think we generally agree with the comments Carl thinkink made today for Nipsey. And so I'm just going to make a couple high level points from our written comments without going into a whole lot of detail, I, I think at a high level, we certainly support the idea in staff draw proposal as we understand it, for three options for compliance within Oregon specific program, the first being rap participation and being an active participant and good standing in that program. The second, and we do see value here in potentially developing an oPUC specific compliance option based on the rap tariff, but perhaps modified in some respects. And then third, the alternative of, for entities that those two options don't work, an RA backstop charge that we've kind of been talking about for a while. And I think at a high level, and there's a lot of detail about how all those would look and what we think, you know, what amendments would need to be made, what's fast working on so far. But at a high level, we, we do share NIPSeC's concern, I think with the transmission issue in the rat framework, that's still an open issue, and it may even continue to be an open issue after FERC issues its order. It's something that, you know, before the binding phase comes along, might even be looked at again. So it's something that we would caution the commission against locking in a firm transmission requirement with no exceptions, bearing in mind there are exceptions in the rap tariff, you know, at this time before you know what that's really going to look like. So that's a really fluid thing. It's something a lot of people are concerned with. So with respect to the point that Mike Wilding just made about the three year forward plan, I find myself in the unusual position of agreeing with, with Pacific course sometimes in these becoming great. But we totally agree. If it's two to three years out, you locking in procurement at the levels, especially level staffs in its proposal is going to be problematic. The LSE needs flexibility to pick what it's going to actually rely on closer in the delivery timef frme but we certainly don't object to a plan that's that far out that shows there's a plan in place to meet expected loads. And then I think finally, just in closing, I want to stress the importance of, you know, having as much detail as to what those requirements are going to look like in the Oregon requirement before the LSC and or its customers, whatever the point of compliance is, need to make irreversible decisions to comply with the Oregon program. So, for example, the magnitude that RA backstop charge is obviously a key data point for that decision as to help to proceed. So we made a lot of other specific recommendations in our comments that obviously I'm not going to repeat, and, but we, I could try to answer if there were any specific questions the commissioners had for me today. If not, thank you again. I actually do have one question, and this might be an impossible one to answer, but, but I was asking initially, Curtis, about the gaps that the Oregon program could fill. If you assume that Oregon wants to make sure that there's a comprehensive approach to resource adequacy for all load serving entities in Oregon, short of, I mean, is it valuable at the right price to have a backstop procurement option? And maybe at the right price or on the right terms makes it an impossible question to answer. But are there, from your perspective, entities that would like to have that option rather than participating in the WRP? Is that a valuable thing that the Oregon would be doing or not? Yeah, I appreciate the question. I think in the abstract more options are always better. And without knowing the level of that charge, you know, it's hard to say what one entity might choose over something else. You know, I mean, the charge should obviously be set at, you know, the reasonable level for what it'what, it's serving, what purpose it's serving. And probably reasonable minds might disagree as what that level would be. But, you know, I think more options be better. So it's in the abstract. That would be my response. I think that's all you can really say because I'm sure reasonable minds will differ on what that charge is. But just in terms of trying to understand where we're putting our resources and energy. Just wanted to pose that question more generally. Okay, thanks. Okay. All right, let's",

        "text": " that people are going to object to. All right, thank you so much for that comment, Ireian. I think we will continue on to the avoided capacity resource. The or Idaho Power commented that, you know, you'd prefer to keep the CCT. I was curious just briefly and maybe getting a little bit ahead of myself into the avoided energy resource, but I was wanting to clarify a comment that recommended keeping the avoided energy resource the same as the avoided capacity resource. If if I were to follow that comment with logical conclusion, would you then have an STCT as the avoided energy resource as well for setting of wood costs? Ryan, if only to buy more time. Can you restate that question so we can think about it? Absolutely. My apologies. That was for Idaho power. I'm curious if Idaho power would be is recommending for them to have maintain the single cycle turbine as the avoided capacity resourced and if they would also like that to be the avoided energy resource. As I understand their comments to saye, this is Andre. For a matter of hour I'll respond on the capacity part in the way we phrase it and based on how we have done this. When I ##aho we proposed to keep the lowest cost dispatchable resource as our avoing capacity, which at this point is a simple cycle commosa turbine into the part. Trying to use something else gets a little tricky battery. You just start getting into winter conditions. Four hour battery is not enough. You have to start getting Derad into the part and see if Adom has something. This complement my response in terms of the energy part? Well, yeah, I guess I would emphasize our primary recommendation is to use a different methodology altogether to figure out the energy component, which would not use a proxy resource at all. And that's that incremental cost IRP methodology that we discussed. So I think if we were still using a. A proxy resource methodology, I'm not sure that we, and I would defer to the subject matter experts on this, that we're necessarily advocating that you have the same resource for both. But there needs to be some consistency between the. If a QF is ostensibly allowing us to avoid a resource, we need to figure out what that resource is and price it appropriately. And it just gets conceptually difficult. If you're using two different metrics to measure the resource that's being avoided. Excuse two different resources. You're ostensibly avoiding two different resources with the same QF. Thank you so much for that. That is helpful. Okay. Thank you. All right, Dana, so just to explain, one of the concerns we've had for a long time about the current capacity resource and why methodology under, um, 2011 so on fixes it. So right now we have a combined cycle and it sets the capacity price, and there's a capacity side and capitalized energy side and so on. But it assumes that the average heat rate times the average gas price is what you pay every hour of the year for, regardless of timing or season or anything. But if we get a combined cycle and we put it in our rates, and we did that in 2014, our last one, you don't run it all the time, right? You only run it when it's economic to run it. And it runs less in the middle of the day to let clean solar power in from California or from our portfolio. And so to the extent that there are cheaper options out there, and we only rely upon this combined cycle a little bit in the spring and evenings in the summer and what have you, there's a lot of extra benefits from being able to use market purchases while still being reliable because you have a dispatchable option to call upon when you need it. That's true of the combined cycle, it's always been true. It's kind of goofy, but nonetheless, there it is. When we run our production cost model and take that combined cycle out, you don't take out that cost over every hour of the year. You just take it out when it was actually generating you. Your reliance on market purchases in the springtime may change. The same is actually true for a simple cycle. While we think of a simple cycle as being a capacity only option, there are plenty of periods when a simple cycle is cost effective. I mean, right now, even at a ten or eleven heat rate, gas is under two dollar two in MBTU. Like a simple cycle is cheaper than almost anything if not for the fact that everything else was even cheaper if it was a combined cycle. But this idea that there's both capacity and energy in any resource, we can't forget that. And in, um, 2011, e three put forward and said, the net cost of a resource, the net cost of capacity after you subtract out the energy benefits that it provides, is the right thing to use as a capacity charge. It's not the all in cost of a simple",

        "text": " we've called the Clean Energy Plan engagement series, which is kind of targeted to perhaps different customer groups or interest groups. Some of the messaging and you conversation that occurs when we're developing our plans. We've got outreach, you know, with Oregon tribal nations through separate clean energy plan engagement series. For that particular group, we've got the usual integrated resource planning or, you know, public input meeting process that we're working through. And then we've got distribution system planning and other community workshops. And there's just, you know, I would say a lot of interaction that is occurring to customer groups that I feel we, we haven't perhaps been directly coordinating or interacting with as we're developing our plans as a result of all of that. And that's really all I'm trying to depict in this slide is that there's a lot of activity there. You know, even in the month of June, we've got a whole host of meetings slated to cover any number of these topics here in the month ahead of us. So as we're sitting here having this conversation, there are folks here at Pacific Group working on materials and pulling data as we speak to, you know, have those meetings and have them be as productive as we possibly can. So that's all I had on this particular topic. If there's no questions, I'll get to the last slide on procurement. O as you're well aware, you we had suspended initially the 2022 AllSource RFP back in September of last year. That RFP Wasig triggered coming out of the 2023 IRP was its kind of action plan that led to that procurement. And when we you issued that suspension, I paraphrased in the four bullets on the slide at the top of the subllet, the top of the slide. You know, the rationale and what we included in our notification to bidders and others as to our justification for doing that. We had obviously, the OTR and its stay as being assumed to be likely, pretty fact impactful now that we've run the 23 IRP update and understand how that does in fact affect the portfolio. Turns out that was probably a reasonable assumption to make at the time. And the whole point was we needed to wrap our head around that and understand what the impacts were right on that particular topic, rather than rush into signing a bunch of contracts that have 20 or 30 year terms without looking at it. We also had ongoing greenhouse gas, you know, rule makings for emissions. We now know what today what those rules look like as well, which we talked about earlier. And then generally speaking, I think we framed evolving extreme weather risks affecting our operational and resource requirements. I think this is a way of saying, are we procuring the right stuff when we're riding through these high impact events, you know, extreme weather events that not only impact our system, but the region as a whole. And we've experienced several of them over the last few years. It feels like there's, to me, there seems like there's always one or two a year that stick out, and that's been a trend now for a few years in a row. And then lastly we have the wildfire risk of l ability, which was an emerging topic at that time in last year, as well as kind of things we wanted to assess before we made a decision on what to do with that RFP. I will say, and you, this is not necessarily explicitly stated in the plans that we filed the update or of the supplement. It's partly why I want to make sure I'm communicating it here today that we have been reevaluating our needs in light of those things. And we're certainly focusing on system capacity that could come online by summer of 2026, recognizing that we've got some near term, you know, could we have a need for capacity in the near term? That kind of, you know, was about the soonest we could procure it, you know, through new contracts or new resources. And then we're doing that, know, in a way that we're also keeping an eye on our financial stability here at Pacific or in light of that wildfire risk and liability topic, as I mentioned. And so you're aware and others are aware, we are making progress to procure battery storage contracts to meet that, meet that criteria online by 26 and maintaining our financial stability at the organization. We've got 400 that procured. I mentioned some of that earlier as an amendment to a previous resource we'd already signed up for to add the battery to that facility. And then we've got additional 755 or so megawatts where we're in advanced contract negotiations. And that pathway is further supported by the outcomes in our most recent IRP update, where we've identified the need for additional battery capacity here in the near York term. That timing on years may not perfectly line up with that, but what we saw as a result of those developments last year in the RFP, where we thought it would lead us, has turned out to be",

        "text": " set of four that you just discussed or was there more that you wanted to say before we. I have questions, sorry, I have a few other comments on sort of some other issues that staff did not choose to make recommendations on. But I think that this would absolutely be anropriiate place to pause. Okay. I think one of my overall questions and I appreciate the constructive engagement and, you know, finding. Sorry, I. For my notes, resolution is great. I find myself going, well, like let's take supplemental RFP condition eleven. Find solution to leave it blank. There's a pretty big substantive difference between notification for battery discharge that's 2 hours versus a couple minutes. I, that reflects to me very different understanding of the use case and therefore, presumably a very different scoring of the resource. And I think one of the things I'm interested to hear about is where you leave some of these blank rather than having these parameters. Does that implicate the objectivity of the scoring when in that example, for instance, really material to the flexibility value that the battery system provides? Do have any response to that issue overall or does that cause staff or, and concern about, you know, how projects will be evaluated? Thank you for that, commissioner. Chair Decker. And I think, I think it's a very good one. I think that. So I think that there is sort of a concern just sort of generally with some of these form contracts. And, you know, I think we're seeing this now in, not to sort of cross dockets here, but in PGE'just, filed RFP as well. I think that there's one concern which is that by leaving, either by like leaving things blank or by leaving so many things subject to redline and stuff like that, that there's a risk that bidders may bid and offer a price based on sort of what their understanding of, you know, what they would like for the contract versus, you know, the utility is then going to be evaluating them based on its understanding. And I think that there is definitely, you've identified a real potential for mismatch there. You know, I think that in some of these discrete cases, I think things like, particularly in issues like the delay damages, I think that that is, you know, appropriate to leave that to commercial negotiations. I agree with you that this one is a little bit tougher because this is actually about, you know, the technical specifications that Idaho powers identified that needs to meet its system, to address its system needs. So I do think that it's a somewhat thorny issue. I will confess I'm not sure that I have a great solution to it other than sort of trying to hammer out compromises where we can. But I think you've identified a real issue that needs to be a approached very thoughtfully. All I needed was validation, not an answer. And I'm happy to, you know, stick with this resolution. I guess I just want to identify it so that if other parties have a thought about how this shows up in later stages of this RFP or how this type of thing should show up in later stages of the RFP, we've at least put it on the table. And I could imagine there being different things that you're looking for from a battery system might cause different expectations there and maybe can or can't get all things from all resources. That is frankly a difference between a third party dispatch system and a utility owned system that I think is meaningful to talk about. And it may just be that, that some of these are ultimately qualitative and we can't really get away from that at some point in these rfps as much as we try to objectively quantify everything. I'm not expressing any dissatisfaction with the resolution that the staff and the IE have helped facilitate. Just pointing that out. Other questions on those or comments, I guess that ended up being on those four issues, I like to clarify. Chair, one thing, Pat, I think you, you know, mentioned the conditions that still seem to be unresolved, and then ultimately I think you're saying there's a resolution here on the horizon, but one that you didn't mention was supplemental condition number two about IDEm, a power providing its proposal about whether or not the benchmark bid assets were going to be made available to third parties. The way I read that staff said that would be important, and Idaho Power said, well, we really can't make any assets available because of the nature of the benchmark bids that they rely on, you know, equipment within the subsitation and partnership with another entity. So I take it from that that staff found that justification or that explanation basically already satisfied the proposal. Since the proposal was that they have to state what they were going to do, you're basically viewing that one as resolved through that explanation. Is that correct? Thank you for that clarifying question, Commissioner Thompson. Yes, I think you characterize it accurately, which is to say that the",

        "text": " that question. Yeah, thank you. And I appreciate the question and the spirit of it. You know, I think one of our big concerns throughout a number of dockets is the pattern of behavior of the ious'presenting, information that we're unable to properly examine or challenge or is demonstrably false, or in this case, for example, unilaterally asserting some discretion that puts all of us in an awkward position. Like, they've just decided that batteries cost this and it's going to be 4 hours, and they swap something out, and that those things generally tend to make it through these processes. And so there's a lack of consequence for those types of behaviors. So I think in terms of the long term consequences, and with all due respect to the work we appreciate in uM 2000, part of this is also sending a clear signal that that isn't acceptable, and because it creates a lot of problems in the future, and we end up spending a lot of time essentially getting into mass misrepresentations or egregiously incorrect things, rather than actually arguing about the more nuanced things that should be the focus of these discussions. So I think part of our request, and why I think it does merit some attention at this time, is to send that signal which pervades a number of dockets. And as we saw in the IRP, again with PGE, I think it was pretty well established in those discussions that their transmission assumptions, which also feed into this model, were just absurd. There wasn't going to be new transmission by 2030 and other timelines and so forth, and yet we then I all have to move forward after that and use a lot of oxygen addressing the absurd. So in this case, some sort of action I think would be appropriate. You also have the benefit, to the extent you provide clear directives to PGE, of asking them to do that work, to minimize how much work staff has to do directly. For example, you could provide some very clear inputs if you were looking for, like, a simple solution. We are seeing a lot of upward pressure in the market. So one answer could be as simple as saying, as I look through staff's report and the things that the QF trade groups summarized, you just say $60, 65 a megawatt hour for the next, you know, 15 years or something that is, you know, in line with the current bids and the second places from the last RFP and some other prices for solar and a different additional higher price for the solar plus storage. And you could benchmark that. You know, you could set a clear ELCC assumption that I'd have to look at the RAAP numbers, but somewhere between the 60% type numbers that are referenced there, the PacifiCorps was using, and the wrap numbers, or halfway in between 80% and apply that times, you know, the associated costs. So some clear, simple things like that, that benchmark, you know, in a defensible, moderate way that I think is established in the record already, and or, you know, a handful of discrete scenarios that could be run to look at that I think would make sense. You know, the number of hours of the battery assumptions like those things haven't been scrutinized. And there's, again, all these interconnection costs and so forth that I think are just massively out of date. And we had issues with them when they were using the twoannon numbers when we had this discussion five years ago or something in 2019. Right. And so that type of action, I think, could focus things and simplify the playing field. And I think you also can lean on, as you pointed out from here in 22 73 order, you know, the commission shall facilitate and ensure, whatever that language is, rapid reduction of emissions. At this point, qfs are a key part of that opportunity. And there's only so many things between community solar net metering QFs and the RFPs, all of which have challenges that you have the tools to work with there. This is one of the areas where actually have a lot more direct authority as it relates to different challenges on the RFP front. Happy to soundboard various ideas and practical solutions there. Ultimately, the solar projects. Solar is the heart of decarbonization is the hard of the future. So if you're looking at a financable project, you know, people are, you know, the market is at 60. Honestly, we're seeing $70 to $80 megawatt hour type solar as delivered pricing to the few places that we can run counterflow transmission. That's where the market is at and going. And right now I'm also very concerned that pgs s rateayers are exposed and bearing rate increases due to pass through market pricing, which is effectively, you know, these fixed price",

        "text": " you grab PGE's presentation? Thanks. All right. Good morning, chair Decker, Commissioner Tanei and commissioner Thompson. My name is JD Podlesnick. I'm the senior director of integration program management at Portland General Electric. Next slide, please. So, to support the continued reliability and resiliency work, we're focused on maximizing the federal climate and infrastructure funding on behalf of PGE and our customers. So it's really important we leverage this funding that's available to continue to help with AFF affordability as we transition into. Into the clean energy. So this slide provides a summary of the progress on our applications as well as a high level estimate on the grant potential and the high level estimate on project costs. As just mentioned, all of these applications have partnerships. And this really has been a team effort on this journey that started last year. Through right now, we've got partnerships between utilities, the confederated tribes of the Warm Springs, universities, municipalities, national labs, research institutes and technology companies, and so on. Each one of these applications, there's two to five partners that are helping be the lead applicant. Sub applicants push these forward. Last year, many of these projects topic areas were in the funding opportunity announcement and early this year, rolling into the concept paper. Since then, you can see many are now in the full application development phase, with some actually getting into review and interviews. One positive note from last week when this slide was submitted, the topic area three, the Trans transmission innovative partnership project, was just approved to move towards full application. So that will be moving from concept paper into application development as well. Just to finish, you can see many of the different areas that were just mentioned are included here. Grid resiliency, grid flexibility, transmission, hydrogen hub, and over in the interview phase, some of the grid service demonstration and that middle mile fiber to connect communities. Last thing to call out, we've included this as well. There's also a FEMA building, resilient infrastructure and community application that's been submitted for our mount Hood area. So with that, thank you. And I look forward to the discussion and any questions you'll have. Great. Thank you, JD. I appreciate that. And we'll hopefully have some time for questions at the end. Let's go ahead and go to Pacificorp and Rohit Nayair. Good morning. And take it away. Good morning, chair Decker, Commissioner Tani and Commissioner Thompson, thank you for the opportunity over here. If I could get the slide for. Yep. I, I think this is a different slide deck, so. Oh, this is Christy. This is the slides for RaA three, I believe. One moment please, while you pull it up. So again, this is Rohit Payyer, the director of engineering standards and grid modernization at Pacific Corp. And leading the federal funding opportunities and also coordinating or with all state agencies on some of these opportunities as well. And as I'm not sure if someone's looking, pulling the slide deck. Yeah, you may. We can just pause for a second when we look for those. And there we go. There you go. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you, Christy. Lot to navigate this morning. All right, so like you see on this slide, basically we'focused on providing a very high level overview of Pacific Corps strategy and our active process for going after some of these federal funding opportunities. As we all know, under this grip formula funding or the Grip general funding, competitive funding, which is the grid resiliency, innovation and partnership program. There are several, several different topic areas. Topic areas have certain focus areas as well. So based on those corp has submitted over the past several months, I've worked with several partners concept papers on several of these. So topic area one. So I'll just give a very high level 22nd overview for each of these. Topic area one, which the focus area is on resiliency, what DOA typically likes to say, steel on the ground. So not necessarily very sophisticated technologies. And some of those pieces, we did make a concert paper submission that focuses on aCet hardening, wildfire mitigation in our Oregon and California territory. We did get an encorage on that one that was submitted for the concept paper. We have several technology partners on that. We have several community partners, tribal partner as well. On that particular concert paper submission, we are on track to make a full application submission first week of April. Topic area two, which focuses more on new technology. A lot of that gets bundled into the typical terminology smart grid. We are looking at again, a lot of different technology options focused on Wi Fi mitigation. That is going to be a six state application that we are focusing on that spans all six states of Pacific Corps service territory. We did submit a concert paper and did receive an encourage again on that one. We",

        "text": " updated avoided cost filing. As we noted in our comments filed this morning, we support staff's recommendation to approve the rates as filed. We also support staff's recommendation to not use this docket and the post IRP update to create a new avoided cost methodology. We think it's far outside the scope of this update docket. We agree it's appropriately resolved in, uM, 2000, where the commission is taking a more holistic approach out Avo cost methodologies. The one substantive observation I will add is, and we noted this in our comments file today, creating a solar and storage avoided cost price is not as simple as simply applying a different capacity contribution to the resource, and primarily because that capacity contribution assumes a certain amount of dispatch control over the resource that typically does not apply to qualifying facilities. And so that is another reason why we think this process should be the new avoided cost methodology, to the extent one is adopted, should be done so in a different form where it can actually be explored and properly investigated. Because it's a complex process. It's a complex methodology that would not be appropriate in a host IRP avoided cost update finaling. Thank you. Thank you. Any questions for Idaho Power? All right, thanks for your comments. Thanks for the written comments as well. All right, let's go to Jake Stevens. Yeah, hi. Afteroon. Good afternoon, commissioner. We can hear you. Okay, thank you. And my camera is not working again, so. Which is a shame. I actually wore a jacket today. But on this point, I think our suggestion is perhaps a contribution here for sort of a practical meet midway approach would be that a QF, which agreed to automatically dispatch all stored energy the same day, to the extent such exists, would be entitled to these standard rates for a combined storage, and that we could adopt an interim meet midway ELCC percent contribution for this type of thing. I mean, functionally, the avoided cost rate methodologies are an energy plus capacity price. And so right now we have these 10% or single digit percent capacity contributions. We have a lot of evidence from a lot of these dockets, um, 2011, that two, 4 hours of storage gets you into the 80% to 90% capacity ELCC type ranges. And so our suggestion would be for 4 hours maybe it's 50%, and for 2 hours it's 30% or something that's just meeting midway, and that there would be a rate available subject to the QFS obligation to dispatch any stored energy each day on the daily. And that would be administratively simple, and put us in a place that there's at least a policy that meets midway in the meantime. That's all. Oay. Thanks for those comments. Any questions for Jake? No? Okay. Thank you. All right. If there are no other public comments, let's go to deliberation. And I'll start by saying two things. One, I don't, or I agree with staff that this docket isn't the right place to do this. I also don't agree that this has to be so complicated that it takes until the bter end of, um, 2000. I think there. I also probably don't agree that there is a place that everyone is going to agree is an appropriate middle ground, because I don't see a whole lot of agreement in this space. But I do want to express a priority on this issue. And just because I recognize that our avoided cost rates, our standard avoided cost rates are behind where the market is in terms of adding storage to solar projects, as Greg pointed out, with respect to the IRPs, I think that Adam is probably right, that it is complex and it can be very complex if you try to get it perfect. It also could probably be good enough. There is probably an interim good enough that I would be willing to consider as sort of an early initiative within 2000, as I think staff is sort of suggesting that it may propose. So those are my thoughts on this topic. Happy to hear yours. Thanks for that chair. I tend to agree with those perspectives. I think I would add that I'm this has been a priority in my mind, in part of the reason to continue trying to push forward the capacity work that we were engaging in previously and that we look forward to taking forward into pricing. So I think we've built a foundation and I agree it's unlikely there will be perfect agreement and it doesn'need the price needs to be directionally right and roughly fair, not perfect to the fifth decimal place, I think, in order to send appropriate signals for what'an? Efficient use of the grid and rateair dollars. So forward to seeing how that emerges this year. Sure. And I can just weigh in and say I agree that this doesnt feel like the right docket to suspend the rate and and try to resolve this issue. And so I am supportive",

        "text": "Good afternoon. Today is July 6, 2023, and we're here for a special public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. We are here today in docket numberm 2274. We are here to talk about PGE' Latest RFP. This commissioner workshop is an opportunity for us to get acquainted with the docket and with the issues that parties have been raising in their comments. I think in the agenda suggested that we'd organize things around for different issues. I thought perhaps, though, as a warm up exercise, before we dive down into the first issue, we might offer PGE if it would like a chance to make some opening comments about its RFP and let staff provide any introductory comments. And we may have a couple of commissioner questions on issues that weren't identified in the agenda that we might want to ask you just before we get started here. To understand the broad context of the RFP. I realized that wasn't on the agenda. So I'm kind of putting you on the spot, Jacob. But go ahead and introduce yourself and if you have anything you want to open with, that's great. Fantastic. Good afternoon, chair Decker, Commissioner Taney and commissioner Thompson. My name is Jacob Goodspeed. I am on the team of PGE that's leading the development of the 2023. All source requesting proposals. I'm joined on the phone today by my colleague Shiraz Bengali, who is co leading that process with me. We're also joined by Seth Wiggins, who leads our resource planning process. So if there are questions that come up today that are a little bit more focused on the CEP IRP side of things, Seth can help us run those to ground. And before we get started, just wanted to extend our thanks to staff and to the stakeholders who have been really engaged in this process so far. Since we filed our draft RFP on May 9, we've held two workshops in which we received really valuable feedback and recommendations from folks. And we've also received written comments with further recommendations on how we make sure the 2023 all SOCE RFP is successful. And we've been able to incorporate a number of those recommendations into the RFP itself, as noted in our comments filed last week. And we continue to balance wanting to make sure that this RFP is flexible and scalable. We know that the resource planning process has put forward an action plan that is unprecedented in terms of its kind of scope and how it outlines the path for the future under House Bill 2021, how we meet decarbonization targets reliably and affordably. And our intent is to make sure that the RFP is nimble enough to keep up with that. And once those actions are acknowledged, if they are acknowledged, we plan to make sure that we're able to meet those actions in part through this RFP. I think that for us, we're also wanting to make sure that we have appropriate guardrails in place in the structure of this RFP to ensure that the projects that we are considering as we kind of move toward meeting those actions are ones that provide best value for customers. We're looking forward to engaging on that more today and being part of this Q and A. So thank you. Fantastic. My question is just, again, before we get into some of the more substantive issues, is whether you can help me understand what might be different about this RFP than prior rfps. For those of us that have been around the block on this thing before, one thing in particular that I noticed that was proposed to be different is the company's approach to scoring, having, as I understand it, no non price scoring and sort of relying on the minimum bidder qualifications and sort of question mark, I guess, in the negotiation of the shortlist. And really it goes beyond no non price scoring and it extends to this sort of like we don't want to deal with provisions of the form contract or require red lines of those. Guess. I wonder if you could just describe your overall vision, not totally focused on that point, but how you're going to work through the process to bring a shortlist recommendation to the commission. Yeah, absolutely. So I think a couple of primary changes in this draft RFP compared to some ones that have occurred in the near past. As I think you pointed out, the kind of one of the headline takeaways is us really working to streamline our scoring process. And in the past there has been a price and a non price element. There was a bit of duplication between the non price element and some of the minimum requirements, and we really looked to streamline that and to make it a bit easier for folks who are interested in responding to the RFP to be able to self score what their project might be and to better understand what we were seeking from the market in this RFP and how bids could differentiate themselves. So rather than, for example, having a minimum requirement that also shows up as a non price score,",

        "text": " know for a fact that it's been talked about that you guys are going to condemn our property without the proper county permits. I heard that. And IAAC. You're not part of the commission. Can you answer that question? You're not gonna or you don't want to? Okay, so, so, yeah, so now I've got some other information here. Let's see here. I've got something here. I think it's pretty important. So PGE is saying that they need this line primarily. They allude other things. They say primarily for the Willamette water treatment facility. Right. You gu. You don't have to ask. You can just write. Am I right on that? So I pull up, I pulled up the tonk and. Go ahead. No problem. I misunderstood that because I thought you did leave it open to questions. So I pulled up the Tompkin substation application. Right here. Kind of right here. And I'll send it to you in an email, judge. And let me just read it to you when they put the talk and substation in. Right. Let me just read you exactly what the reason for them putting in. Analyst says. Additionally, the talk and substation is needed to support the Willamette water supply project. Oh, the same reason they're giving to put in the power line store neighborhood. I mean, that's kind of interesting, but they didn't mention it in their original application. And the inference there is there's going to be plenty of power from that substation to run that facility. And that's a fact. So let me read a little more here, because I think it's important. And this is PGE. This is not me, this is PG. Their words, not mine. Says right here. Let's see it. What project? Treatment plant located directly west of the site and will improve service reliability in the immediate area. Meaning not only would the substation. You'be. Able to take power from there, but there's enough extra power to provide power to other places. So they got surplus power. Okay. Ve. It says the proposed location minimizes potential negative impacts of a new substation. On existing and future residential areas. Like not having to run this line through our neighborhood kind of thing. Right? Then it says down here, it says, let's see, so that it can be distributed out to neighborhoods for power supply to homes and businesses via local distributionized. So there's plenty of power there. This is not a necessity and this does not require the waiver period that it says down here, which I think is interesting. It also dictates the distances need between the equipment and other metal objects, fences and trees, which can conduct electricity and cause arcing, which PG told us, oh, this is just not a problem. Don't worry about the arcing. You know, your kids are safe on the school bus directly under this power line, which it's gonna be. It's going right over the school administration building. Then it sit it down here. This prevents accidental electronic arcing between equipment and either other equipment for people, which could cause safety concerns for workers and nearby residents and pedestrians. I mean, that shock they'remitting in here that this is dangerous and there's still will to do it. They don't care one hoot about us. And if there's a problem or there's a fire, guess what? They're going to come down and they're going to come to you guys and say, oh yeah, it's a billion dollars. We're just going to raise rates. We don't care. And so I think that their very application covers the Willamette water facility 100%. This line is not needed. And this whole redundancy thing, that's just a farce to put more steel on the ground and get more money. I mean, if you think about it, you're going to build a five x on redundancy. If my power line breaks, what are you going to do, run another 10,000 bolts through it? I it's sitting on the ground. I mean, this redundancy thing is ridiculous. So that's really all I have to say. I think that this is important. This document is PG's own testimony. It's why they put that in. That's adequate power for that facility. This is not a necessary project and it shouldn't happen. And you guys should vote tonight to knock this wave outute and make DG go through the normal process like everybody else. That's all I got. So I've got a few names here I just want to go through to see if you intended to comment or not. Ktherine. Kffman? No. Jerry Dick? No. Stevee. I was going to you with somebo call I'm going to go ahead and my name is Steve. We're basically on Staffford Road at 22 720 and we have two barns, steel barns that are right underneath what the area they want to condem. Now, PG told me",

        "text": " also and see if, see if that, if we do catch it with that other screen, even in this preliminary fast track screening process. Yeah, that sounds good. And that is based on the batteries project, which you, we worked with in conjunction with EPRI to create that screen. And they've done a lot of work on the grounding practices and whatnot. And so I'm hoping we got that honed in. But yeah, I need to chat with them and probably ray walling about what the differences between that and 47, whatever 1000 547.2 is pointing to. Or you are there different assumptions or something? And I know one thing staff will be interested in is the, the 115 547.2. It's currently in draft. And do we incorporate draft rules, draft requirements into this or not? And so something is that 80% going to be a firm number going forward, so we'll be interested in that. Thanks, Tad. I mean, 1547.2, it has passed initial ballot. It's in research right now. But that was not changed. I can tell you that much. That language did not change. Okay. I'm not familiar at all with the full process of updating the standards, so I don't know if it'll have an opportunity to be changed later or not before they're published. That's if I'm even talking about that correctly, their process, as there were no changes on it, in the recirculation, then it should be locked in at this point in time. Okay, yeah, we'll probably looking for some language for that as well. So I'll put something in the summary. Thank you. Well, I don't know, Brian or anyone else. Do we think we have anything else on the penetration screens that's worth going into more detail to discuss? All right. Hearing nothing, I guess. I guess not. Ted, if it would be helpful, I can kind of say, you know, Irx, I can kind of give us a summary again of, you know, what Irric is thinking to kind of close this off. And I don't know if the utilities want to give a summary of what they're thinking to close this off before we move off this topic. Would that be helpful or should we just move on? Summary would help for sure, and if the utilities want to summarize that, it'd be fine as well. Thank you. Yeah, I guess, you know, so, yeah, I guess, you know, I feel like we've said this before, but I know when it comes to, you know, supplemental review, you know, you know, Ir strongly believes that 100% is, you know, the right number for the penetration screen there that has been used successfully for, you know, for many years. And the rationale behind that is not that every project up to 100% must pass all of supplemental review, but only that utilities should not categorically be able to reject all projects up to 100%. And if they have an objection to a project up to 100%, that there needs to be a specific reason provided for failing one of the other two screens. And again, we don't, you know, object, you know, to the utility, you know, as the screens are written right now, all of the details that we have gotten into on this call are not addressed in the other two screens. And so that means ##s to the utility discretion how they would fail projects in the other two screens. And as long as sufficient documentation is provided to the customer that they're using their internally developed standards. As Brian mentioned, we do think it would be a good exercise, you know, in the future, you know, perhaps for the commission to go through those individual utility to standards and discuss them and get a little more detailed about know why and what level those are set at. But that wasn't something that IR was proposing being included in, you know, in the supplemental review screens at this time and historically has not been included in the supplemental review screens. So that's kind of our thinking. And then I think I just went over, you know, tier one. I think we're comfortable with it being set at a lower level. You know, there could just be less definition on 100% or if we can get, you know, consensus around 90%. I think that's something that, you know, that we could agree to as well. And I think that pretty much sums up where Ireac is at. Thanks. Y go ahead, Lisa. No, go right ahead. Thank you. Sure. Yeah, I just wanted to jump in to see. I think this is one of those issues that engendereded some discussion. I think the utilities have heard some things from ireac that they weren't, you know, aren't totally prepared to respond to with specificity. But it's been really helpful to hear and understand the discussion",

        "text": " the other options as you try to unpack what the path forward is for Idaho power, or are there options that are not on the table that you're not going to evaluate, or is it too early to know? Excellent question. I think the answer is, well, for this last IRP, the 2023 IRP, we did allow those units to exit early within the modeling if that was cost effective, because we wanted to know that that gives us the ability to talk with our partners about what would be best for our customers? I anticipate we'll be looking at all of the options that we would consider as possibilities in this upcoming IRP as well, so that we can come to those discussions knowing what's best for our customers. Great. Thanks for that. I appreciate you unpacking that. I know there's a lot of uncertainty there, so appreciate that. Thanks. You're welcome. I think I want to, oh, go ahead, Commissioner Perkins. I think I want to venture one question about recommendation ten and the QF renewal issue. This is one of those that we wrestle with a lot. We benefit from just landing on something and recognizing that the outcomes are not generally really material. There's not a lot of information yet to come to an evidence based conclusion about renewals. Idaho Power is different. That is a principle that I know we hear a lot. And one of the ways that Idaho power is different on this issue is just how much capacity you have, that energy you have that's come through the QF route in my mind. In the near term, however, this action plan window, the amount of capacity that's of subject to renewal is still in that of on the margins category. Recognizing that for you it might become a lot more significant down the road and we might need to eventually land somewhere. That is based on the specific experience that Idaho power has with renewals. Given your place on the transmission system options that QF haveab, can you help me understand your perspective on the practical implications, not of taking staff's approach forever, but for taking it in the next IRP and how those differ? Yeah, I appreciate you teing that up. Recommendation nine is to work with parties to come up with a nonero renewal rate for wind qfs. Recommendation ten, which you teed up, is specific to what we do in the interim. That recommendation is suggesting in that in the in between time when we have not yet negotiated and worked through something with stakeholders, that we adopt a 75% wind QF renewal rate. And we do understand and staff has explained very well that that is a methodology that the commission has adopted that has been used for other utilities from our perspective. 75, we're not disputing or trying to work against recommendation nine. We fully hear that parties are looking for a non zero rate in the interim. What that practically looks like is that for the entire 2025 analysis, we would need to adopt. If recommendation ten were adopted by the commission, we would have to use a 75% wind QF renewal rate in the 25 IRP. And our concern with that is primarily, we don't have any evidence to support that high of a renewal. And I'd like to just note we're seeing renewal. That's quick nomenclature for a replacement contract. What we're talking about is when these contracts reach their end of life, there isn't a quicker path to renewal. These are entirely new contracts that would be set at new terms. And the key piece there is that the majority of our wind projects, both by capacity and number, are in Idaho and the terms are significantly different than when those projects initially signed. So our concern is really that, that we would be knowingly going into a renewal that we can't support based on facts on the ground or based on the policy environment that we have in Idaho. What we believe is a very reasonable alternative that gives all that information is we are happy to perform a 75% when QF renewal or new contract rate within a scenario like we've done. And that has the benefit of giving us the exact information that all stakeholders are asking for without the potential negative consequence of us misstating what our capacity need is in the very near term. And your re right chair that in these near term couple of years, maybe we're talking about capacity on the margin. But I would just point out, I think the commission is well aware we are seeking capacity on the margin. We are out for many rfps. And so when we're saying just 1020 30 mw, that's significant. And the consequence of misstating that in the over is that we missed the mark on what we need to procure. And so it seems like with that in mind, the scenario is an excellent opportunity without creating any negative consequences. So I'm not sure if that fully answered your question, but that's why and where we differ from staff and stakeholders, I think that's helpful. I think you're just",

        "text": " contract. And I'm fine making saying that these changes need to be made. I feel like if something changes from what we say here, we'll see that in the AI and probably be open to argument about why should be allowed. Yeah. And I think that, you know, you know, as you noted, PGE object to this. Noted that customers aren't exposed to incremental risks in this case. However, you know, it wasn't clear. It maybe been better to bring PGE up to see if there's other aspects of their objection that aren't fully being captured here. It seemed to me that one that this is an unusual. It would be unusual to sort of see this play out in these particular types of projects, which to me suggests that you may also not be problematic to remove it if it doesn't seem like something that's going to happen in either case. But again, I'm not an attorney and PGE probably, and IFC could speak to how they see this playout for each of them in more detail. Fine with that. If PGE webs to respond. Hi there. I'll take the opportunity. This is for the record, Charles Bengal, PG on the RFP team and nothing really additional to add to the comments that we've already said in our reply comments. But I do want to just address maybe something Kim brought up in her comments about saying that some of this was around customer protections. And I will just note that the PRR does have some very direct protections for customers. So we're already trying to be very transparent in terms of how the operations and activities of that affiliate would go so there are protections in place and I think we would just point to those as protecting customers in addition to our argument about why we feel the no consequential damages clause should remain. Thank you. I guess. Thank you. We'll permit a quick response from Arian and then probably just need to decide and move on than. Thanks. Chair Decker. I wanted to correct one thing and I could be mistaken, but my understanding is that PRR is just going to use the form PPA that is approved here so that there may not be an opportunity for additional changes down the road. This isn't something that's going to be necessarily be negotiated. So what you're approving here has a much bigger impact on the PRR PPA than the PPA for the affiliates where it's going to be, or not the affiliate, the PPA for other bidders because that will be negotiated. But this PPA isn't supposed to actually be negotiated. So we took that in mind. So we were trying to eliminate provisions that we thought we're going to restrict the ability to provide rateair protections. Ok, understood. I don't think we got written comments from you, Jake, on this one. I think we're just going to need to move on and decide it. So in that event, fine. I'm inclined to support the staff recommendation and I think it applies as well to the mobile Crierra provisions. So lets just, if thats okay with you, K Commissionur Tani it is. And to Ireianss point, I think what is dont think approving this with the information we have now for me at least, forecloses a very thorough review in a eye docket of whether the contract appropriately manages the complexities of customer recourse on non performance and so on. There are a range of issues we raise in the AI docket. And so, you know, just so folks understand this is, I think that we will, there is significant space to develop that discussion in the AI docket, but I understand, iren, that this will be heard loudly in that docket. So just putting a pin in the limits of this decision. Okay, thank you for that. That's valid. Okay, so, staff Kim, do you want to go to pr participation condition eight? Yes. So condition eight is that PGE should assign pre COD and security delivery amounts across PPA and E EPC anDP eight contracts. That amounts the issue. There was, we'd heard from a few stakeholders that these, the prices for the pred security and the delivery period security and the contracts were too high and unreasonable. And one of the examples that was given was that Nipsey in there? Comments from June noted that the similar terms for utility bill projects were lower and there wasn't really a case to be made for why that security would be lower in those instances and they also proposed some specific values. The staff was not inclined to assign the specific values but to say at least they should be consistent across these different types of contract. I guess the thing that didn't make sense to me here and was a little persuasive maybe about PGE's responsees is that PPAs and EPC contracts are doing very different things. So it's not clear to me that what you're securing or protecting against would be the same. Without having more information. I'm having a hard time just establishing a heart and fast rule that they be the same. Ag",

        "text": "% requirement, but I guess I want to note that all of this is subject to some amount of optimization on the leastase cost Le or a strategy for getting to most, you know, as much of all of this as we can. Right. And right. So that's what's missing for me. That's really helpful. I thought you meant what's the other way of meeting the small scale requirement. And I'lost, and I'm not sure how many other ways there could be, but you're looking for the sort of the counterfactual, sort of incremental cost. And I totally agree. Very curious about that. So, oay, totally aligned. I wasn't clear enough about that. And thanks for clarifying. It just was odd to me that that was sor of inserted before you looked at different things, but it makes sense. But anyway, thanks. Yeah, I suppose I would suggest that further on in the presentation when we talk about compliant pathways, that may help to inform the conversation. I do think it is very notable that while small scale renewable resources have the potential to contribute to, you know, different emissions, for example, if we dropped out the small scale resources and then attempted to meet the emissions target with utility scale resources, you would see a cost savings similar to how we evaluated what the cost of the small scale renewables are. But anyway, I would suggest that the discussion of compliance pathways that is coming up may help with this conversation. Yeah, understood. And I assume number three is kind what you're getting into. What's listed as number three on this slide is what you're getting into in the next section, so. Right, yeah. And specifically, the point that simply adding small scale resources does not get you to. To compliance. Adding more small scale resources would not get you to emissions compliance. But I'm front running that, so let me set that side, please. Oh, sorry. Yeah. So just to do the very short recap, you know, in addition to reporting costs and risk, the CEP portfolio gives us data on comparative reliability and emissions metrics that are discussed later. So that really dovetails with where we're headed. And if there aren't any further questions for discussion, I believe I'm ready to turn it over. Good afternoon. You mean, are you able to unmute, or do you need to? If you've called in, you'll need to press six. Oh, there we go. Okay. Can you hear me? Yes. Oh, perfect. Okay. My name is Zepur Xiaian. I'm the director of energy and environmental policy. Thank you for the time chair, Decker and commissioners Ti and Thompson. I'll be going on over the GHG emissions component very timely and in line with the discussion that we were just having. So I will. I think there'll be opportunity when we look at the emissions trajectories between the IRP, the IRP with small scale, and the two pathways we can revisit, you know, the strategies that we employees here. Next slide, please. Okay, so Pacific Core is forecasting that we will meet HB 2021 goals. However, it will not be without challenges and will require new non emitting resource technologies to develop. In our planning Pacific were identified three important components so that influence our strategies and planning overall. First, paific work is forecasted to have substantial load growth in Oregon. So we're looking at 60% increase in load relative to when the targets were set by 2030. So our targets. Our load in 2010 to 2012, when our targets were. Were cast, was 60% less than what we're looking at, 2030 and 80% by 2040. So the challenge with load growth is that while the emissions per megawatt hour that we generate decreases substantially over time, load growth results in just higher absolute total emissions. And so this was something that our forecast had to overcome at a steepaper rate than we would have had our load stayed the same. More load also creates proportional increase in small scale procurement requirement because we need additional capacity to serve larger load. The second aspect of our planning was related to conversion of coal fire units to natural gas fired unit. Coal to gas conversions are economic for customers, but will continue to contribute emissions. There are benefits of avoiding additional resource costs and hedging against reliability risks. If new technology is delayed. But Pacific Core will have to manage emissions by minimizing use to serve Oregon customers. And the last planning component was that IRP and CP are informed by cost allocation assumptions. So maintaining the benefits associated with the companys access to markets and resources across the state poses specific issues regarding discrepancies between forecast and actual compliance. So next slide please. There, can I just jump in with one question? And thanks for that. I have a question just I wanted to see if we could dig a little bit more into that load forecast. I don't know",

        "text": ". They ask questions such as how do I harden my home? What is the right vegetation to plan around my home? So there's a lot of good things that we can in these forms that we can share information by bringing our partners into them. Now I'm transitioning to, we talked about all those other tools to prevent a public safety power shut off, but this is, it is a fundamental tool that we will use and we did exercise it last September. I will not go through the whole, what we call our bell curve of planning, but just in general know that in our plan we have a daily operations call with our on staff meteorologist looking at the weather and projecting that weather. And if we get noticed that extreme weather event will be happening. We will launch our corporate incident management team. We will be working with our ESF twelve and be going along the communication requirements as dictated by rule. And we will watch this and escalate as appropriate. But we will do our 72 hours, 40 hours and 24 hours notifications and then turn off power. And again, this talks about how will we bring power back on on the tail end. We did a lot of learning last year in this space, you know, because we want to turn our power at just the right moment in time and not turning off too early. So we had, you know, we were turning power off in the middle of the night, so like two or three in the morning. And so trying to communicate with our customers in that space, we had a lot of learnings and how to do some adjustment to make sure we're having timely communication before they went to bed. This next slide just talks about what I was alluding to on the bell curve of all the communication. This is on our WP as well. I will point out that, that the channels of communication may change as a result of those communications that we're going to have with our public safety partners and understanding how we want to leverage Everbridge to notify customers and those that may be in the area. So this may change slightly, but this in general gives you a real good idea of all the different channels we are utilizing to inform the public and our customers about the potential power shut offff and the actual execution of it. One of the other things I mentioned already, one of the other things we learned on the backside of this too, is that, you know, as we're bringing power back up, we were, you may be in a PSP's area and power may be coming up as we do our inspections, but we're not turning off that area or saying it's all back and up and running until the last customers up. But that's kind of giving the wrong impression that it's. That people are not coming up as, as we move along inspection. So we got to do a better job there trying to show how the power is being restored over time. One of our tools, and PATC talked about this as well, is we have our recharge and relief strategy, which these are our community resource centers. And as last year and this year we will provide ice and water information, charging and Wi Fi. We, our strategy in this space has been to work with a contractor that we can have these as pop up locations and we haven't predetermined where they will go, but they're also very mobile if we need to adjust them. But one of the other things of, one of our lessons learned I'll talk about here shortly as well, is that just because it's such a flexible model, having good communication with our public safety partners is something we have to improve upon and make sure we have better communication there. The last thing I want to point out in terms of the plan, and then we'll go really deep dive into the lessons learned, is that in our plan we are, are proposing a portable battery pilot. In this pilot, we have looked at our partners to the south of us in California, and what we want to do is to see if there's a way that we can help better support our medical cert customers that are relying on batteries for their medical needs. And so this pilot will allow us to really understand how we can do this program cost effectively and efficiently and in the best, the best intentions for our customers. It will study procurement and distribution and the customer experience. And then this will actually give us some other ideas too, that what is the here it's really about the medical devices, but is there other possibilities to expand this program and think about refrigeration to keep medical or medication cold, for example. And in the interest of time, I'll go speed this up a little. F so I talked about a lot of these and lessons learned, but just some of the highlights on this that I just wanted to call out were 1 second, really, the, the overspray with the Everbridge. So that, that's again where I think we learned a lot of utilities in general about, with the overspray",

        "text": " the project would be under Prudence review, most likely in each of those jurisdictions. At the FERC, the Prudence review would be under and for Idaho powers transmission customers. And so those would be taking wheeling service from the company, such as Bonneville Power Administration. And then the Idaho Public Utilities Commission would of course oversee the Idaho power native load customers that are served directly by Idaho power. And then the Oregon public utility commission would look at the costs related to the Oregon customers. And I do not have a percentage that would go, or a dollar amount that would go into each of those, but the prudence would generally be looking at the total cost of the project and then determining how to what percentage of that is allocated each of those customer classes at FERC. And I'm real fuzzy here on how FERC works, so please excuse my ignorance here. I have a general understanding that once the revenue requirement for b two H goes into the oat, that those costs are automatically added to IPC's rate that they can charge to their o customers. And there really isn't a prudency review. It's an automatic thing that's already been established by FERC and policy. Do I understand that correctly or am I kind of way off base? Yeah, Mister Caro, the company does have a formula rate, so generally cost to go into the formula go into rates. I believe that there are prudence opportunities in that process through different FERC filings, but I am not aware of what exactly those are. And that would be a for only transmission customer, not for Idaho powers customers. Native lo customers. Right. So the native load customers would be Idaho powers customers in Oregon and Idaho. The o customers would be the point to point or network customers that correct. And those customers are kind of more FERC regulated, whereas the native customers are regulated by the local public utility commissions. Okay. And Mister Elsworth, could you just verbally state that answer? Oh, sorry. Yes. Correct. Thank you. One other question. Well, another question that I have is, does Idaho Power foresee any other amendments being put forward to ode within that site certificate process? I to object that this question goes beyond the scope of Mister Ellsworth's testimony. Mister Ellsworth hasn't testified about any additional amendments. Thank you, Miss Racner. Mister Crder, if you could identify a part of Mister Ellsworth's testimony about that, otherwise, I would ask you to move on. I'd be happy to withdraw that question. And with that, I will also end my questioning of Mister Ellsworth and I apologize to everybody for taking too much time with Miss Burretto. Thank you, Mister Crider. Up next, we have Greg Larkin or his representative, Irene Gilbert, for an approximately 25 minutes cross examination of Mister Ellsworth. Miss Gilbert, will that be you asking questions? Yes, ro. Thank you. And I just start out. Miss A. Elsworth, could you tell me what your role has been in the development of the budget for the budget figures that we have been presented for the B two h transmission line? Miss Gilbert? My role in developing those is very minimal. I'm mostly an acceptor of the budget for B two H for the purposes of integrated resource planning. And so I take the budget that is developed by Miss Burretto, as well as her team and our constructability consultants, and then utilize that for IRP planning purposes. But I do not develop the budget for the B two H project. I can't say this is a difficult topic to ask questions on because the public has had so little access to information. But I'm going to object, your honor, to the extent that Miss Gilbert appears to be commenting and testifying when she ask questions. Thank you. Miss Ragar, please try to constrain your questions to the direct question without extra commentary, if you were able. Okay. In the. In the current budget, it. The total basically has stayed the same between 2016 and 2022. And I've been trying to figure out what the factors are that would make that happen. Is someone talking? Can you. Can you enlighten me on. On what it is that what issues have increased? What issues have decreased? And I'm thinking, particularly now, of things like materials and labor and that kind of thing, or just what were the changes? I'm sorry, I'm going to object again. Mister Ellsworth just explained that he did not participate in the development of the budget. Rather, he accepts the budget and uses that, the budgeted information in his IRP analysis of b two h. Anyway, my concern is that Miss Gilbert may have the wrong witness for this line of questioning. Thank you, Miss Racner. Mister Ellsworth, I'd ask that you answer the question to the extent you have information that is responsive to Miss Gilbert's question. Miss Gilbert, could you point me to",

        "text": " that requires it to be disconnected from the grid and that that disconnection is going to occur faster than 2 seconds, and if the DER does not disconnect more quickly than it can cause islanding, which can damage equipment or other customers, can damage the system, could create safety issues for utility personnel and reliability issues. So, you know, the alternative to including this flexibility in the rules, I think, from a safety perspective, is to require all interconnection customers to be able to have the highest possible reclosing speed. Or stated differently, that we would make the rules, set the rules based on the sort of the lowest common denominator. And that's not what we wanted to do here. We wanted to account for the fact that some circuits have high speed reclosing. We need this optionality, but not all do. And so we're trying to avoid imposing stricter requirements on all interconnection customers then is necessary in all cases. And if they. Yeah, can I ask a question about that? So the rules. I appreciate the highlight of how the rules may offer flexibility. So my worst case scenario of, like, we have to go back and do a rulemaking every time the technology allows for the inverters or other technology in the project to accomplish what the high speed reclosrs are intended to accomplish, it fix that. Is that going to then just be a case by case discretionary decision for PGE? Or would there be some kind of handbook or way for the commission to provide direction if it felt like PGE wast getting out of step of the norm without having to do a full rulemaking? Was curious about your sort of process thoughts there that could make me feel more comfortable with this. I have not given much thought to the process. I certainly understand and appreciate your concern about the need for a new rulemaking, given just how long it's been and how long these take. I think that we. You could. I'm not sure exactly how it would occur through the handbook process, but that's a possibility of a way that the commission might be able to weigh in. Certainly, we are going to. Through, um, 20 111 and through the different handbook changes and comment process, going to be, I think, having a lot more dialogue with interconnection customers outside of just a one off complaint process than we've had previously, and being able to hear their concerns there. So I'm not sure. I'm sorry, I don't have a clear process in mind, but I. There's going to be. No, there's still time. I mean, if there are more comments to be filed, I just. I'm trying to be clear that I need people to be thoughtful about this so that they don't end up with a result that's not good for reliability and security of the grid. So if there can be some thinking on a path that we could offer to our future selves or colleagues before the record closes, that would be helpful to me. Thanks. Thank you. And I can address the third issue quickly, which is the eligibility for tier one net metering. The joint utilities don't object to the current proposed rules which do align the eligibility for net metering, tier one and small gen tier one. I do think that we would have concerns about making changes in this docket to net metering eligibility. In general, that seems deserving of a broader conversation, potentially with additional folks who haven't been involved to date. But in terms of the tier one eligibility criteria for analysis under tier one, support the rules as proposed. If there are no additional questions, I think that's all I have on the first three issues. Thank you. All right, thank you Miss schoo over chair decker or commissioner Taw, any questions? Okay, anybody else wishing to comment or that would like to comment on this first group of issues that we've put under the heading of technical items? Yes, Mister Zakai hello again. My name is Yohi Zakai and I'm here today on behalf of the Interstate Renewable Energy Council with my colleague Mhat Mafazi, who you heard from earlier, and I hope if it's okay, he's an engineer and I might ask him to address some items with this second issue that we're discussing around u the response time for export controlled relays Ire rec respectfully requests that the commission adopt the model rule language for non export relays that's found in the battery storage interconnection toolkit and the most recent version of Irex model rules. And that would involve deleting the sentence that allows the relay time to be less than 2 seconds on high speed reclosing circuits. In our conversations with lots of utilities and the Electric Power Research Institute over the three year period that led to the development of the Department of Energy funded batteries project, we didn't hear these concerns from any other utilities on the use of relays, and we have not seen any other states that have adopted export control rules use this language. That's what I'll say from a process development perspective.",

        "text": ". That's what you're talking about. Those are the signed contracts that you were just talking to the chair about? Yeah, ive not gotten there yet, but. Yes, and then. Yes, exactly. But then when I look further, when I look at the differential, the differential table below let you get there, you see a bunch of numbers in parens. Those are procurements that were described in the IRP. What are now not going to happen in the IRP update. I'll let you open it. Sorry. I think. No, that's okay. I believe that is accurate. Those are net reductions in that window, and I believe that's correct. So we're seeing really substantial deceleration in the solar, solar batteries, and that's that being displaced by that coal that because of the OTR. That's sort of your, that's the interaction that I'm seeing happen. I believe that's fair. And, you know, to keep, perhaps to keep in mind that, that OTR's a little strange. It's. Right. It was a summer program. It's really only applicable may through September. In order to replace the summer energy, though, you still have to go out when we had that in the IRP 23 IRP and get resources to replace that energy that's lost from that fleet in the summer months. But you know, you're still going to generate that energy in the nons summer months when the OTR is not applicable. So there, it ends up being a fair amount of extra energy right on the system as a result of how the seasonal element of that OTR. And so you eliminate that summer program and you just need less across the system in general. And I think that is, was key. A huge driver to changes in the resource mix and portfolio between the IRP and the IRP update. Now, before we can I say it back to you in a different way. You were going to end up energy long on an annual basis as you try to cover the summer and energy needs? I think so, because you still have the energy available, at least, although you may not be operating it as much, but you have the ability to produce energy, you know, from the thermal fleet that can dispatch outside of that ozone season if you can get the fuel at a reasonable price. Okay. At some point today, I would love to understand the sort of scale of market exposure and seeing on the west side in BAl in these resource balance tables, but I'll let you keep pushing forward. Sincek, I think we're, you've got more content, so thank you for helping me make sure I was reading those parens correctly and understanding the dynamic. Okay. All right, Candace, if we could go to the next slide, please. Thank you. So probably should have talked about this one first, buting the emissions trajectory trend concept together. You know, we heard through the review process under LC 82 around the 23 IRP, a lot of commentary and discussion around how we came up with our portfolio in that plan where you simply stated, we created a preferred portfolio for the system and layered in, on top of that kind of additive to that portfolio, any incremental requirements necessary to achieve, let's say, compliance under HB 2021. And in large part because again, the fundamental system plan was already at a place due to the federal requirements under OTR, with pretty substantial emission reductions falling out of that obligation in the IRP itself, the only incremental addition we ultimately ended up think for the most part, adding was the small scale requirement, but layered that on top of the core system, unconstrained portfolio from the system perspective. You know, I think a lot of folks didn't like that for various reasons. We heard that message loud and clear. And rather than waiting to try to do something about that until we got into the 2025 IRP, we took a look at what we could do pretty quickly in terms of doing something different, responsive to that discussion that we heard in the update itself. And so I alluded to it a bit earlier, but we essentially developed an Oregon specific portfolio. We then also developed, we did it for Washington as well. They have their own requirements. And we kind of overlaid those two state specific portfolios relative to our system portfolio and found a couple of things. I think, one, there was a lot of commonality between them in terms of core resources across the system, but they are different. And where there were additional requirements under a state policy, we then started to reflect those into the system portfolio and develop then a preferred portfolio that reflects and integrates the elements of the two state plans. Both Washington and I know here where focus is on Oregon as well. So we ended up with a hybrid portfolio that is not just the system portfolio with adders for small scale renewables. We have a preferred portfolio in the IRP that reflects",

        "text": " are proposing in in this last draft of the Stroud rules. And with all this comes the larger issue of transmission, which we have spent a fair amount of time discussing today. And finally, once again, with the overlap with AR 651 and direct access, there's an unresolved issue of how to deal with the ESS's obligations and how much we could rely on the utilities provider of last resort capacity. All right, and next slide, please. Okay, so with all this and with all the feedback we've gotten from comments and workshops and the information we've learned today, staff's next step is to draft some formal rule language that will be distributed to stakeholders in the resource adequacy docket by the end of the after that, we hope to spend the next month first opening a comment period to get some reactions, and then holding a workshop to hopefully synthesize those reactions into a better second iteration of rules. Assuming that goes fairly well, we hope to do the same process again ofafting or drafting and releasing an updated set of rules, opening another comment period and holding another workshop and assuming that that all goes to plan and moves forward as scheduled, we hope to move this to a formal rulem making sometime in March. But with that, again, we're still, we still don't quite have everything figured out yet, and we're hoping to synthesize this with AR 651 as much as possible. So we'll see where that all takes us. And with that, I'll open my section to questions. Excellent. Thank you very much for that sucinct summary of where staff is, and I always appreciate the work going back to first principles and objectives. And I see in the rulemaking scope and straw rules an objective to have a state level program fill gaps. Maybe you could characterize for me the primary, I guess, gaps that lead staff to continue to believe that a state level program is important to layer on to, theoretically, a regional program. Yeah, so I guess the two gaps that I can identify right off the bat are, as was, as mentioned in the WECC program, resource adequacy is a whole interconnection wide problem, not just a statewide problem. One of the gaps we see is what is if we do have an entity that is not in some region wide program, it does seem like something worthwhile to prescribe somer rules to make sure that they are adequate enough. Another gap that we're seeing, or that I think think is that is just as general issue of time horizons, whereas with ious we do have this IRP process. It allows us to peer into what the longer term resource plan is and give some feedback to it. With esses, we don't quite have that, which, as this, as has been discussed by WEC, a planning horizon of ten years, not five years, not one year. We do see some value in having some rules in place that do have some binding language to. To incentivize entities to come with us to. With a longer term resource plan. Um, let me unpack that second part a little bit. Um, just the time horizon issue. So if I'm understanding the WRP program correctly, they'd be using a two year forecast and requiring a showing forward of seven months, but they'd also be providing a five year forecast. And so. So I guess I'm just trying to understand if the gap is sor of between. You're seeing the regional program as being really the seven months to two years kind of thing, and the five year look that participants are asked for their. Isn't useful enough for Oregon's purposes. I realize I didn't ask that question very well, but, yeah, just trying to track between the time horizons that I understand to be part of the rap program and the gap that you're identifying in terms of forward look. Yeah. So I think you'summarized it essentially in the same way that staff is thinking about it. Was there, was there a question attached to that or was just a confirmation of. Well, I guess I didn't understand what. What the gap is and what you're proposing the right horizon is. I heard you say ten years. I heard you say five years. So, yeah, yeah, my mistake there. So, as I understand the wrap, the binding season is that seven month time lookout, whereas our program, as, as proposed last set a rulem make, was a three year binding period. And that is the gap that we're trying to help. So even if you might have visibility, say, from material submitted to the rap program for two years and maybe even five years, what you're postulating is that it would be useful to have something that's binding further ahead. I see, yeah, exactly. Particularly in the context of we might not have every entity in Oregon participating in the ramp. Sure. Okay, thanks. Other questions? Commissioners, got about five minutes here just to follow up on that last question. I think that was an important",

        "text": ", and that is to modernize and streamline the screening criteria that are used before a project gets to study. We added a supplemental review process so that projects could make it to approval even if they failed the screens without going to a full study. So kind of an in between step. We're explicitly authorizing the use of energy storage, brid and other non export projects in a technology neutral manner, which should be, as chair Decker mentioned earlier, future proof such that if new technology comes about down the road, it should continue to be able to take advantage of those non export provisions. And we're authorizing the use of advanced inverters that comply with the new IEEE 1000 547 standard. To respond to Commissioner Tawi's question about, you know, where are we not going with these rules? It was specifically microgrids were called out, and I wanted to note that these rules focus on energy storage and not microgrids as a system. That would be a heavy lift, one that I haven't seen other states tackle to date, but I'm looking forward to getting involved when we're ready to go there. Cause I think it's gonna be a really interesting topic. I wanted to echo the utilities recommendations that the commission move quickly through the formal rulemaking process. The sooner that we can get these changes implemented, the sooner this streamlined process will be available to customers and moving away from the consensus areas, I wanted to address two areas that have come up briefly and one in a little more depth. So first I'll go over the brief areas concerning the NEM tier one eligibility. Really, the request here is to use the 25 kilowatt export capacity and 50 kilowatt nameplay rating that has already been agreed to in the SGIP procedures in the NEM procedures as well. I acknowledge that this is not a request to increase the residential memcap, but there are commercial projects today that can go above the 25. If those projects use an export limiting features such that their nameplate is under 50, their export capacity is limited to be under 25 kw. They would be able today under the proposal to take advantage of the simplified screening process under tier one so it future proofs it for residential customers, but also makes certain small commercial customers available to use the expedited procedures today. The second short comment that I'd like to make is agreeing with ReC about the interconnection Requirements handbook. Specifically, two items that ire rec recommends are included. Is that challenges to the handbook? You know, if a customer challenges the handbook, that the utility would be required to file those challenges, the parts of the handbook that are challenged with the commission for review, and that in that filing the utility would continue to bear the burden of proof. And I'm just concerned that if the rules do not require the utility to make the filing, that the customer might end up bearing the burden of proof when challenging the utility handbook. And that's something that I'd want to avoid. Okay. And then, oh, and then in response to Commissioner Decker's question about that, I did want to respond as well that we have seen this process used in other states as well, where if the handbook is not challenged, then it's allowed to go into effect. But if it's challenged, then it, you know, starts a commission process. And I think it represents a reasonable compromise between not needing to involve the commission in every decision but allowing them to weigh in where there is a dispute. Then lastly, the item that I wanted to address was updating the nameplate capacity of projects from the existing DC values to AC values. And the reason why I wanted to bring this up is because it's in a little bit of a different procedural posture than the rest of staff's recommendations. And that is, it's not a part of the rules, but it's a recommendation for how the adoption order should be structured to include an additional requirement for the utilities. And because it's in this different posture, I think it's important to highlight that and make sure that the commission's comfortable when moving forward into the rulemaking phase to address this issue in that way through the RUL making phase. And I'll briefly describe the issue as well to avoid overestimating the impact of Ders on the distribution system. IREIC asks the commission to order the utilities to update their databases to include nameplate ratings and alternating current. Because the current databases for many older projects only include direct current. The most important aspect of this proposal is to specify a date certain for utilities to complete the conversion. IRX supports staff proposal to set this date at one year following the adoption of new rules, and then in the interim there would be a requirement for utilities to update the data where circuits have hit a a higher penetration of distributed energy resources, therefore making them more likely to fail the screening process. Ire REC would prefer that the threshold for these interim updates be set at 70% and you know, we look forward to having that discussion",

        "text": " few questions, I suppose, about all these proxy resource, you know, maybe smaller updates regarding the solar and wind and integration cost schedule, what the companies's delayed plan to delay of resource acquisitions, you know, affect the flexible reserve study from the 2023 IRP. Certainly we could recalculate the reserve requirements specific to any portfolio, and any portfolio change would, would impact those results. We haven't done that calculation. In general, the trends that you see there is relatively high in the near term and then falling over time to a relatively low level. And that's primarily based on the availability of battery storage as well as the penetration of renewables. When you have a lot of battery storage, providing reserves is low cost, there's a lot of, lot of flexibility sitting out there and it could make up for any changes in output if necessary. That's for reserves. The other side of it is also as we get more renewable resources in the hours when the renewables are mostly generating, the marginal cost of energy on the system is relatively low. And so there's a lot of, not just batteries, but everything else that's available to dispatch up. And so, you know, the cost of keeping that capacity available, it's already available because the renewals are making it that way. So with a really high penetration, you know, the marginal costs tends to fall. So there's a lot of factors going on in there. And it. Yes, it would change, but I don't, I don't know how much it would change or that it would change that much. I appreciate that. Oh, Greg? Yes. Yeah, I had a few questions about the renewable proxy resource. If now is a good time to ask this, please go ahead. So first of all, it seems there's in the table with the work papers in the filing, it identifies a east side solar resource in 2025 as the renewable proxy resource. But in the description of the rates in appendix to it refers to a renewable wind proxy resource. So I was a little confused by that. What is the renewable proxy resource? The math is done based on that solar resource, and if we incorrectly updated the description, apologies for that. Okay, thanks. So, yeah, so my question, I mean, the resource is the prices are going way down compared to the wind proxy, the prior wind proxy, which we already thought were pretty low. So we're pretty concerned with that. I mean, I think when we pulled the average prices that are public from the most recent RFP, I'm aware of that were filed with the commission, they were in the range of $60 per megawatt hour. But I don't think these prices are anywhere near that. So we're having trouble kind of understanding how the QF renewable proxy prices are so much lower than what we're seeing being bid by actual projects. I mean, these are the assumptions in the 23 IRP. I would note the capacity contribution for the wind proxy was significantly higher and the adjustment for capacity in the different schedules, if we had a wind proxy, might make the cost go down depending on which type it was and exactly what the contribution differences are. So you're saying that the fact that it's a solar resource instead of wind causes the wind and basel load renewable rates to be higher. Right. Okay. But yeah, I think my question'getting at though, kind of like the cause of the resource, which is kind of the basine used to calculate the rates. And you're just saying, I mean, what's the support from the IRP for what this cost is for the solar resource? I mean, those are the costs assumed in the IRP that we developed in 2022 based on then current contracts that we, or offers that we had received. I don't know much what else I could say than that. And a specific course position that these are still reasonable costs that you could acquire a resource like that in the market today. I'm not sure about that, but I do know that they were used in the IRP, so. Okay. Andn't, but they're not specifically approved in the IRP. I mean, this is where we're sening the rates. Certainly there's always an opportunity to debate the inputs and the assumptions and what is appropriate. And, you know, we, we have not attempted to replace the assumptions in the IRP with different data because that is outside of the rules. Okay. And Pacific, is this the first time a solar proxy is used as itosed to wind? I don't recall, but it has been wind for a number of years. Okay, and what was, why was the termination made to make the switch? Because it's forecasted to be cheaper. I don't recall our exact basis for wind versus solar. They both exist. I think there is more solar in the IRP in 2025. Okay. All right. That's all I had on that.",

        "text": " of those, as well as the methodologies that we employed. And here is a flowch chart showing our current IRP development process. What I'm really hoping to illustrate here and to see if I can get a good pointer. All right, looks like it's working. Is that this long term capacity expansion process in Aurora is only part of our process, really. We have a reliability tool that we use to calibrate inputs prior to running that model, and then we use those, that same tool on the back end as well to ensure that our portfolios are reliable as we move through it. As Allison mentioned, we've seen some pretty drastic changes in some of our inputs. One of those is just our load forecast. So in the 2021 IRP, it looked like this. And now you can see we've got quite a bit more load that we're forecasting. Quite a bit of it is industrial driven. And here's what we're looking at over the next several years. You can see that the numbers are pretty high. We have a couple of industrial customers that are driving a lot of this growth, but the other factors are in there as well. Can I ask on this slide, you've pointed to the industrial customers, but I see winter is growing less quickly than summer summ. Summer is continuing to sort of out strip. Can you. That I would anticipate industrial would be sort of, I mean, flat around the year, but maybe that's not right. Can you help me understand why that gap is widening? What's driving that summer growth? Now that's accurate. A lot of that industrial growth has a very high load factor. You might see some separation just based on the load ramps that we're experiencing from each of those customers and when they add their loads throughout the year. But yeah, typically, yeah, you'd expect them to be fairly close. I'll reach out. Jared, do you have any further explanation on that? There may be a bit of a lag, but there may be some other factors as well. I guess I would just add that we are seeing a lot of additional load growth from a lot of our other customer classes as well, like residential and, and whatnot. And so that's the reason we still see that. I think a typical year would have been like 50 to 60 summer load growth and 20 winter load growth is like what we had been seeing historically, winter growing a lot slower than summer. So the industrial load just kind of shifts that whole thing up, but you still see a bit of, little bit of that gap between the two o. Okay, so you anticipate that separation between summer and winter to continue to forline as we go? Yes. Okay, thanks. You bet. So there were actually quite a few scenarios and sensitivities that we ran for this IRP. The blue squares in the middle represent just different future potential scenarios that we looked at. And the dark green on the side. Some of the validation and verification runs that we performed, really we focused on these green scenarios. We were trying to make sure that we were making the right decisions on a few key items. One of those is b two h. So confirming that it's a good thing for our customers still, as well as looking at in service data impacts, depending on when that line would go into service, certainly. Valumy units one and two, looking at the coal to natural gas conversion and determining whether one or both units made sense. Swip. We talked briefly about the transmission line, looking at that and seeing whether or not it made sense for our customers. And then Gateway west looking at all three phases and determining what made sense with Gateway west. So the results here, this is a comparison between the 2021 IRP and the 2023 IRP. One item, the bridger number one, or unit one and two. We had identified that coal to natural gas conversion, and that paved the way to looking at other units as well. The other two units at Bridger and both units at Valmy. We're determined to bring costs down and keep the system reliable. Our endpoint for emissions is much lower, and we'll show that in a future slide. B. Two H was confirmed as cost effective, and Gateway west transmission is now also a cost effective part of the plan. It enables us to integrate more renewables onto our system. And, of course, solar and wind, we're seeing a ton of that. Just very cost effective way to produce energy. Storage, and transmission is still an effective way to integrate those resources. And we're utilizing all cost effective energy efficiency and more demand response than was identified in the 2021 IRP. All right, so here is, you know, the actual resource build or the identified additional resources that we've identified to help serve load as we move forward. I wanted to point out the timing of these conversions in 2024. That's when Bridger units one and two",

        "text": " sort of riskier portfolio than you have historically run? I would say the 2021, sorry, 2023 IRP was an area where we started to constrain in the plan in a reasonable timef frame our reliance or ability to buy from the market to achieve our reliability, to meet load reliably, you know, from a planning standpoint, reducing the available market purchases right. In the planning process, we couldn't do that immediately because you can't build a resource in a year of thing, but over a reasonable transition period. And, you know, that's the path we were marching toward. And I think the reality is that these, some of these financial limitations that niki address are walking that back a little bit. We are probably going to have some reliance on the market at times as a result of kind of not pursuing all of that wind, solar battery on the system. But the reality is we really can't do that today as we sit here right now. So what can we do? And when you're kind of faced with that real question and, you know, you, you know, we want to reliably serve our customers is first and foremost what is the best way for us to spend the funds we have to do that. And that's the strategy we've come up with. And I think that's what we do see in this plan in terms of that focus on capacity and battery. But the reality is that it's a constraint in our decision making, not just on the resource run across the organization that we have not necessarily had to consider over a year ago. It's a new element to our decision making process here at the organization. So given those constraints, I'm curious where just straight power purchase agreements, longer term power purchase agreements come into play with your capital constraints and then looking at all of the potential variables and risk associated with fuel for the coal fleet and natural gas, that's where my brain goes. And it may be overly simplistic, but just curious how long term ppas play in versus company owned resources that require capital. Yeah, Nikki, if you're still on, do you want to answer that part? Yepep, I can address that. So the main difference becomes the cash flow and the timing. So in that PPA world, we are spending the money over the 20 year horizon versus in the capital. When we own a resource, we're investing in it today and putting forth the dollars through typically borrowing from a debt perspective, the money in order to fund it all UPN. So it's that funding upfront that is our constraint right now is our ability to borrow significantly more is limited. Some of that limitation is on various metrics. We have capital structure, how much we're going to leverage, or then just how many investors, if we continue to lever up, are going to be interested in investing in the company, particularly if we end up with another downgrade. So that's the difference is s really that timing of how the cash flow is needed from the company relative to when it would collect it in rates, maybe. Can I try rephrasing the question? Commissioner Perkins so why can't you just find more ppas to close your open market position then? Thank you. That goes back to Rick. I think from my finance position, that would be a better cash, less of a cash constraint for us as we move forward. So that's why I had indicated likely as we move forward for the next couple of years, it would be ppas would be most beneficial to our constraints and the metrics that we have to meet. Yeah. And, Nikki, don't go anywhere. If I could ask to stay on the pan, because I think there's still an. An element of, you know, I think Nikki explained very well just that an owned asset versus a PPA has very different cash flow implications, but there's also still sort of a credit related issue as it relates even to power purchase agreements. And that's an area, too, where we've been you. We've evolved in our thinking and understanding around that, too, quite considerably over the last year or so around what that means. But it can affect the metrics, even doing power purchase agreement, particularly capacity contracts, more so than energy contracts. But so there is a pathway to still, it's not saying we can't do power purchase agreements. We have to do them at the right level to not jeopardize, you know, kind of what we're buying, not sitting on the cash flow side, but even from a credit standpoint. And, you know, I've been coordinating with Niki's team on that front more than I ever have before, since I've worked here for 21 years. Right. And that's it. That's why I say that this is a new constraint that affects how we're doing business. It's checking in. Are we, you know, what is, do we think the impact is of this contract on those metrics? And, you know, how many more do we think we're going to do? And",

        "text": " a substantial change, and I wonder if you could articulate your perspective on that. And then when we come around to other stakeholders, I love to understand PGE view on that as well. Absolutely, Mister Tani. The post IRP updates include a multitude of updates. There's factors such as increased load growth expectations, different resource generation characteristics, the system tuning assumption used in the ELCC modeling, along with staff's recommendation number nine, that ultimately affected and impacted that ELCC number. The absolute magnitude of any one of these changes is something maybe the company could speak more to. I would say that's really my understanding of what went into that. So just sort going back to basics, we had them seeing a penetration of solar where the next increment of solar was not bringing a lot of capacity value, but by with really substantial load increases and some of the other data changes, we're seeing that with the new data, the next increment of solar does bring substantial capacity value. Is that the sort of the plain english, plain english ish explanation that I should take away? I think you'accurately boileed that down. Yes. Ok. Okay. So this is our iterative process sort of at work. We had a perspective based on the data we had. The data has changed and the methodologies captured that change. It's sort of a staff'viewing this pretty big swing, correct? Yes. Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you chair. Yeah, I have kind along similar lines, just wanted a little bit of explanation. I know I got some answers prior to this hearing, but I think it's an important point to talk about the relationship between the ELCC value and pricing, and really the decrease in capacity value when you add battery to storage, to me was of stood out and was counterintuitive, I think a little unclear on what your question is, commissioner. So are you saying that the, the move from the single cycle combustion turbine or combined cycle to a four hour battery and just that relationship to the value of capacity? It just seemed counterintuitive to me when I read through it and I think I understand as you explained it to me. But I would love to hear because I think it's just an important part, important point to get clarity on. Absolutely. It's hard to, I would say take any one change and ascribe a change in price directly to that one input. The price of capacity in this filing is notably higher, comparing the single cycle combustion turbine to the battery. As for the change in the ELCC numbers, I think that's primarily a function of the changed portfolio and assumptions around load growth and the tuning assumption that was updated. Yeah, I guess that wasn't very clear. That value relationship is complicated. It's not a single point. But that was the part that I was trying to tease out and I think in the explanation or discussion that I had previously, that a lot of the capacity components are related to timing, of that capacity being available. And so the proxy that's being used and the timing, can you talk a little bit about that? Just in terms of the wind resource, the solar battery in particular, the, the relationship of energy available to the four hour battery component and how that affected this particular outcome? That modeling that, you're asking a lot of pieces. That is a lot. So there's a lot of modeling that goes into these, of what it costs. The company's solar dispatch modeling did not change across these filings between last summer's adoption of the solar storage rate and this filing. I would say that the value of solar plus storage may not have necessarily decreased when considering the impact of the avoided capacity resource being updated. That also comes with a different ELCC for this resource. And so one, they'compared there's multiple things to keep in mind, and I'm thinking I might pitch to Scott Gibs here because he's well versed in this modeling. Yeah, thanks, RN. I think as you've captured, avoid costs and ELCC modeling and all the changes that are coming out of the IRP, all are interrelated and there's a lot of moving pieces going on. So it is very difficult to identify just, you know, the impact of one single change on avoid costs generally, although we do have general idea of which direction these changes are pushing things a couple of things that I would note in terms of the, the solar PL storage compared to the other renewable ratess, there is a different compensation structure. And so, you know, the premium peak hours, you know, it's just 4 hours during the weekdays where all the capacity payment is captured within that. So when we're looking at prices on kind of a levelized basis that to some degree can be flattened out. Whereas you know, when you actually look at the high load or heavy load hours from 06:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. compared to just those 4 hours during",

        "text": ". Thank you for your time. Appreciate it. Thank you, chair Sepa and I'll try and be expeditious about the first ten slides or so we've got. But before I launch in a little bit about why we're here, there is this vision in the document and we want to help you, help us, and have a conversation about how we might further shared goals. And I think we probably do have shared goals with the state of Oregon and with the Oregon PC. Please ask questions as we proceed through the presentation and maybe we can go to the next slide. As chairman Sapa spoke, the creators gifts are extraordinarily important in the commission and its management roles. One thing, what you see here is a graphic representation of first foods. And these are explicitly referenced in each of our four member tribes treaties. So the right to take salmon, to take game roots and berries. They'explicit. They'so. Important that they are explicit in the treaties. Lets s go to the next slide. So Critfik is composed of was founded and composed of four or indian tribes. And each of those tribes now has their own energy programs. Yakima, Nez perce, Warm springs and Eumatilla. And collectively with them and with the biologists from the tribes and numerous experts from the region, we published the 2022 Energy Vision. And since its adoption by the commission, we have been guided in some of our implementation efforts, at least by a steering committee from the tribes with representation, particularly for Makima power, Warm springs power energy and Nimiu energy. The Umatila tribe has assigned its director of natural resource programs to our steering committee. Let's go to the next slide, please. The commission is composed of the Yakima, Nesirst, Warm springs and Umatila tribes. Our mission is to ensure and unified overall voice in the overall management of the fishery resources and to protect treaty rights through the exercise of inherent sovereign powers of the tribes. We are recognized by the federal government as a political subdivision of our member tribes and with the wisdom of our member tribes and our governing body, were able to branch out and serve the needs of the people along the Columbia river. From community health and Covid needs to planning a better energy future for the Pacific Northwest. Let's go to the next slide, please. So a little bit about more context about the tribes. You can see in the middle picture. The shaded areas are those lands that the trib, in their treaties of 1855. Those are the lands where they exercise dominion and continue to this day to implement fish and wildlife projects. Probably more than 300 projects in that shaded area in the interior Columbia basin. It's large. It's about the size of the state of Georgia. You can see in the graphic on the left. It's also about the size of a portion of Great Britain. And it represents most of the salmon habitat in the Columbia basin above Bonneville dam. About 90%. Let's go to the next slide, please. So we've talked a little bit about the importance of Santa to the tribes. What I've learned over my career is how intertwined Columbia river salmon are to not just the hydropower system, but the energy systems of the northwest. Obviously, the federal Columbia river power system is a huge player, not just in the northwest, but along the west coast. And its footprint is massive in all four states of the northwest. And its footprint includes, as I at least think of it, the transmission systems that have been built by Bonneville and other utilities. And now, as we get toward this new era of renewable energy development, we stopped and asked some questions about what does this mean for the hydro system? Will it be good for fish? Are there opportunities? And we found some interesting things, and we'talk about those as we proceed. Next slide, please. The energy vision is stated in the first bullet, and we've emphasized some key words here. Clean, adequate, reliable, affordable electricity, healthy and harvestable salmon populations and protection for the future. As we published Energy Visions in 2003 and 13, 2003 came on the heels of the 2001 energy crisis when protective measures for salmon worker tailed in the federal system to supply energy to the northwestn California. That was unfortunate. Next slide, please. Again, the three elements, key elements of the energy vision. Healthy and harvestable fish and wildlife. That became clear to us as a mandate from our member trib while we were preparing the document protecting tribal treaty rights and cultural resources, the Umatila tribe in particular, bro. Us brought to our attention the need to consider upland resources, not just the rivers resources, but what does it mean to develop transmission and solar arrays in areas where theib. Rob, you're breaking up a little bit. Would you be able to turn your video off while you're speaking for a few minutes",

        "text": " The first one is that they would automatically get Clackamas county land use approval. The second was that they need power for the will laamette water treatment plant urgently. So, of course, based on this information that was granted. Unfortunately, since then, the first assumption was incorrect. PGE is very unlikely to be granted land use approvole because the project violates the Facims county comprehensive plan which Stafford Road is considered a r scenic road. And there are three major deficiencies in their county applications that we do not believe they are going to be able to meet. The second assertion that they made involved emancy PGE which this commission undoubtedly used this urgency as a big premise for granting the waiver. Understandably. But this was a disingenuous at best. In order to push this project through PGE suddenly asserted that getting power to the Willamette water treatment plant was urgent. We've been involved in this for a year and never heard of this. The plant is a $1.3 billion project that's been under construction for over three years. But suddenly the Stafford Road portion of the Tonkin project is critical to powering the water plant. The existing Tonkin substation is directly across the street from the water plant. It has 30 to 50 times the load output that the water plant requires to operate. Additionally, on page 146 of the City of Sherwood land use application the water treatment plant states that diesel fuel is exclusively used for standby generators. In the case power from a substation is lost. Another point brings us to the conclusion that PGE is not being transparent or honest? The Willamette Water Supply project website was boasting about how the filtration system is run on gravity to conserve power and how the stateat of the art facility will have full backup battery power in the event the power grid fails. Since the involvement of PGE, the backup power information on their website has mysteriously disappeared. The last thing I would like to address is PGE's dlicitous efforts at community outreach. The Tonkin project has been underway for over three years. However, our community first learned about this project in July of 2023 when many homeowners received a letter from PGE stating that they are seeking to inspquire easements on our properties. The letter we received was not signed by PGE, but by a right of way agent that was contracted a company called Universal Field Services. After exchanging dozens of texts and emails with the field service agent it became clear that he was not able to answer any of our questions. He tried to be the mediator for PGE, but each time he promised they would get back to me and no one ever did. Each time I would call, Justin would tell me that they were out of the office or not available or would call me back. And they never did. After many texts back and forth, Wear arranged a meeting on August 29. PGE had to cancel this meeting because of scheduling conflicts. We then arranged another meeting, taking time off work again on August 5 at 10:00 a.m. and verified that PGE was aware that many of my neighbors would be attending because they had questions about the project. Justin said, this would be fine if they have general project questions. The day of the meeting, they did not show up. They didn't call me. They didn't text me. I and 20 to 30 of my neighbors who all took time off work to be there waited for almost an hour for PGE. 2 hours later, PGE sent an email that stated, upon arrival, we were surprised to see well over a dozen vehicles lining your driveway and became concerned that our meeting go would not be attable with so many people present. This and individual set up booths at the public meeting made it clear that PGE had no intent on meeting with our community unless it was to sign their proposal. So again, from the 10,000 of view, we asked that you please consider the necessity and implications of this project at large. But down in the weeds, please consider the financial burden that this has placed in our community with these proceedings. PGE has been given a waiver based on disingenuous assertions. They now should be required to go through the normal process, land use approval and then PUC approval. This would alleviate the immense dual process financial and logistical burden in our community, as well as your staff. Thank you. ##lo my name is Joe Rody and I live at 25015 Southwest Stafford Road. I am on the opposite side of where these poles will be placed. So I guess I'm speaking on behalf of those of us really don't have any recourse to what happens to the other side of the road. I was riding my bike near Don, Oregon, saw a realtor sign on some property and decided to give her a call. And in the course of our discussions she asked where I lived. I said,",

        "text": " recent irps, it said something like, you know, PGE has a capacity need on this date, and we'll procure this volume. And that's kind of been it from a resource perspective. And this is a little bit more complex. And that there is kind of that near term need, very near term need. And then there are mid to longer term things that we should do as we work toward a longer term target. So I think that we are exactly kind of what you're noting, Commissioner Tani. We're kind of looking to find that right lever to pull to make clear that we have a near term need that is urgent and that we really need folks to respond in helping us fill. And then we also have projects that we would like to see throughout the action plan window and to determine kind of what that best value proposition for customers is for folks who could come online in 2027 or you maybe have a longer lead time resource. Okay. That's helpful for articulating these two. These two buckets. Thank you. All right. In theory, I have some questions about your future RFI, but let's leave those to another day because we already have some hands up on this issue. Well, thank you, Jacob. And we will ask you to come back when we want to talk about the system conditions transmission product. But I would invite anyone who wants to speak to this first issue around the cod that's influenced by these transmission issues and also the characterization of the need to raise your hands. And we will go in the order that they are listed. So let's start now with Valerie Baross, and then we'll go to Jake Stevens and then Irene Saner. Hi, folks. Sorry, I'm trying to start my video here. There you are. Yes. Yeah, nice to see all. My name is Valerie Barrows. I work at brightight power. I've been in the developer IPP side of the business for just over a decade now. So it's kind of the context of where my questions are coming from. Largely on topic here. Cods. What's the right cod to consider, given all of PGE's need? But I want to expand just a bit more beyond the BPA transmission. And what Commissioner Thompson said really resonated with me earlier. I want to just drill down one step deeper on what he started with the implications not just around the BPA transmission requirements, but really a little bit more broadly around the rigidity of the minimum bidder requirements. Right. The transmission requirements are one part of that, but also from a permitting perspective, it's close to, like, a shovel readting project. It's a very late stage de risk asset that they're looking for, which I certainly appreciate having been in this business so long. There's a premium on that now more than ever. We understand that here. But I do want to point out that actually I believe that when in the pack northwest specifically given the challenges around'm developing here that are different than in an ISO where you have a broad range of buyers that you can sell to. I think it's in PGE's customers best interest for PGE to loosen these. And the reason I say that is this, if bright. I was founded by putting a lot of strategic interconnection positions in the PaC Northwest thinking about bringing home value for customers of certain unique ious. And when you do this, though, if you think about the risk reward trade off for the developer it might be a great deal for PGE customer. But we, as the developer, taking on huge risk. Right. We're. We're developing a project that's really custom fit for, let's say, PGe s system and PGE's needs. And by making these minimumget requirements so rigid you're really making us bring things, like, all the way to the finish line before you'll talk to us, essentially. So I would discourage that because it discourages more developers from stepping in and thinking really uniquely about PGE's needs. What it makes on the development side. What it makes me want to do is say I'll plug in somewhere on BPA system where I can try to sell to a lot of folks. That might not be the best thing for PG s system from PG's customers. So that's my comment, is that I think that it is not in PGE's customer'best interest to make the minimum bidder requirements so rigid. I think that they should. Absolutely. These are really important things to consider. But I think they should be considered as one of the many lenses that the projects are evaluated on. I'll pause for a minute. Does that make sense? Any follow up questions for valerie there? Sure, I'll ask a follow up question. I appreciate your engagement. I guess when it comes to the cod, for example, PGE indicated, okay, we'll loosen that a little bit and we'll give people a little bit. But we're still going to prioritize projects that are in the nearer term.",

        "text": " by business lighting projects. In 2022, we actually increased business lighting incentives and made some other changes to encourage more customers to participate in these offers and to make it easier for them to participate. These changes took a little bit of time to catch on, but by 2023, savings and participation rates we were re really exceeding our expectations and we think that this demonstrates what we all know well. Sustaining offers for several years builds trust with trade allies and distributors, and it enables us to ultimately reach more customers. On the gas side, our results benefited from those changes I mentioned earlier that we made at mid year, including increasing incentives and outreach to business customers. So next, let's look at our energy generation results on the next slide. So in 2023, we achieved 124% of our goal overall. That's 132% of goal in PGE service area and 113% in Pacific power service area. Again, these results exceeded our performance measures set by the OPUC for solar energy generation. We also exceeded a minimum spending requirement under House Bill 3141 for renewable energy activities that benefit customers with low or moderate incomes. We spent 35% of renewables revenues on these activities, exceeding the minimum requirement of spending 25%. Spending in 2023 included $4.5 million in incentives for solar within reach customers, which pays a higher incentive for customers with low and moderate incomes, and additional incentives for community solar projects that expand capacity for low income subscribers. Another highlight for renewables in 2023 was the launch of our first battery storage incentive in mid year for residential customers, covering up to 60% of the average battery cost. When paired with solar, battery storage can offer critical backup power during outages for essential equipment while also providing grid services such as demand response. A battery incentive offer for businesses, tribal, nonprofit, and public buildings is expected to launch in the first half of this year. Okay, next, let's look at results compared to our 2023 performance measures on the next slide. So for those who may be joining today's presentation, who might be unfamiliar, the OPUC sets annual performance measures for energy trust that actually establish minimum expectations for a variety of our activities and investments. And I'm happy to say that in 2023 we met or exceeded all of our performance measures. So starting with energy savings and generation, as I mentioned, we exceeded all the minimum energy savings amounts within the levelized cost requirements. We exceeded our solar energy generation requirements and exceeded the minimum investment requirement on renewable energy activities that benefit customers with low or moderate incomes. We also met other reporting requirements related to renewable energy activities, which are detailed more in our annual report. So next slide please. And so here are some more of our OPUC performance measure results. We met our performance measures related to financial integrity, to customer satisfaction and NIA reporting. This year, the commission waived limits on our administrative and program support costs and staffing costs. This was really to allow for more spending to stabilize our workforce and add staff to provide flexibility and capacity to expand our services and meet increasing demand for energy efficiency. And then last on this slide is our benefit cost ratio requirement, and we're going to look at that in just a moment. But let's go to the next slide first. So 2023 was the first year OPUC established equity performance measures and targets for energy trust, all of which we met or exceeded. The first equity measure here established a target to spend $1.8 million to support nonproit organizations serving environmental justice communities and nonprofit led initiatives. We far exceeded this requirement, spending about four and point a $5 million in 2023, and a large portion of that was through our community partner funding incentives. In 2023, both our commercial and residential teams expanded this offer, partnering with more community based organizations to deliver more of these enhanced incentives and reach more of the priority customers that this offer was designed to reach. For instance, for single family residential customers, we and our CBOo partners served 805 sites and delivered $1.6 million in incentives. That was up from about 500 sites and $900,000 in incentives in 2022 for multifamily customers. We and our CBO partners serve 527 sites and delivered $1.8 million in incentives, up from about 100 sites and $230,000 in incentives just the year before in 2022. Our spending total for this target also included grants to support capacity building for nonprofits, contracts to support workforce development activities, and other small contracts and sponsorships. The next equity measure here was to increase outreach to environmental justice communities by adding ten combined ftes. We exceeded this minimum requirement by adding 13 and one quarter ftes between our staff at Energy Trust and our program management contractors for a total now of 29 and three quarter FTE supporting outreach to environmental justice communities. The next measure here was",

        "text": " set amount of time after the rules make sense. I think one month is probably insufficient, but maybe something like two months would work just for staff to keep in mind. I've noted that. Jordan, thank you. If there are no other questions, I do want to hear if people have any thoughts on updating current data or the current projects that are currently interconnected. And what type of timeline would it take to update that data, because I think staff would like to put something in the proposal to have the date updated. So just throw that out there and see what people have say, hey, Ted, I know Eric Anderson just had some connectivity issues, and I think he might be the one to respond. So if he's on, he can interrupt me, but we might need a minute here. Yeah, well, as long as you can hear me, I'm back on. I don't know what happened with my computer there. I can. Good. So we have done some preliminary outreach to ETO to figure out what that data transfer might look like. We. The discussions haven't progressed very far, so understanding the complexity of what it'll take, we still haven't gotten to that level of discussion yet. I know that each utility is sort of differently situated there. So coming up with a standardized timeframe for how that would progress might be pretty tricky to include in the rules. Perhaps if there is some. If your goal is to ensure that level of transition for the historic interconnections, you may want to design that flexibly, at least until we've gotten some more information from energy trust on their timeframe for being able to provide the data so that we can then analyze a path forward for integrating it into our data. So I guess the short of the answer is we've had preliminary discussions, but the when we do it and the actual procedure of how we do it is a real gray area at this point. So. So that's the background information. So I. I just get concerned about a specific inclusion of a timeline for mandating that it happens when the discussions are still really preliminary. Okay, that's good to hear that you're starting some discussions. I'm not sure if it will be incorporated in the rules or if it would be more of coming out, like as an order out of here to update. I do think it would be good to have a timeline in there and, you know, might even break it down into the limited generation feeders first and then the other feeders. But I don't know if Jenny's online, if she has any thoughts on that as well. Sorry to put you on the spot, but if you do. Thanks. Hi. Yeah, no problem. The opportunity for data sharing. Yeah, we are talking with PGE about that, and I think there's some. Maybe some misunderstanding or miscommunication about the request that's on the table. And, Eric, I think there's some. Some opportunity for clarifying that request and what that timing looks like, because I think there's a few different, parallel. Parallel conversations that are happening. Since we're both using power clerk, I think it kind of comes down to aligning the data fields and then updating, being able to provide updated data for the inverter capabilities in coordination with those aligned data fields. And that would be true for PGE and for specific power as well. Since we're all using power clerk, we are currently updating our version of Power clerk to better capture information on battery storage systems and smart inverters. And that's a process that's taking place here over the next couple months. And my understanding of the original data request from PGE was to share data by the end of Q two this year, which was the kind of deadline we were originally tracking on. But I think there may be some misunderstanding, and I'm happy to follow up offline and make sure that we get clear on what data is needed and what timeline that is needed by. So, Jenny, this is Eric for PG. That works fine. That was a timeline that we proposed in some of our communications to, like, get the original data or to get some of the data, to look at it, to figure out how complex this is going to be. But like I say, maybe for Ted's perspective, we are working on it. It's going a little slow because it is, you know, two different entities, it teams that need to, you know, pull the data together. I think that only sort of speaks to the PGE sort of take on the issue. I think the other utilities may have concerns. So that's where some flexibility, probably important. Thanks, both of you. Anybody from Pacific Corps, Idaho Power, have any thoughts on this. Hi, Ted. This is Mark Patterson with Idaho Power Company. Oh, yeah, thanks, Mark. So, in March of 21, we started rating systems about their ac size. So any system that's gone in since or applied since March 21 is on the AC side",

        "text": " By the end of August, it's quite cast and starts to get really hard to shift. And so I think there is an urgency to the question that the chair is asking. I feel a real urgency to the question the chair is asking around, despite the trickiness around how much more is appropriate, because waiting until February of 2024 will mean we cannot really be ##gin scaling them until sometime in 2025. Maybe so, yeah. If I could just say the thing that maybe in my mind could be further developed as the process goes forward in the dialogue about near term costs is just, that is the concept of cherry picking which things get of pulled out as too expensive in the near term. Absolutely. We've been in IR two irps ago or something, or one IRP ago, whereas a key concern of the commissions multiple irps, that large amounts of procurement that lower long term cost and risk in the modeling have near term implications that are unacceptable. And I think we're really still grappling across all irps with how to show both of those things and make transparent decisions about that. And I think the thing that might be, again, need to be further developed for me in that dialogue is sort of like, why this instead of one of these other things that gets pulled out, we've talked about. Well, anyway, I'll just leave it there. So just so you know where I'm coming from, I don't think there's anything else on that question from my point of view. Happy to keep going Orer with my questions or defer to one of you round robin style here. Go ahead, Commissioner Thompson. Sure. I'll ask one question. It's the only real area that I have. But just to describe the interest, obviously we already talked at our last meeting about the challenges of, you know, forecasting exactly how, what kind of resources it's going to take to get to 2040 compliance. And so for me, that, as I mentioned last time, that's a meaningful finding because I think it lets us all know that the pressure's on with respect to new resources and technologies and, you know, 17 years to figure that out and actually have them deployed and serving load is really not that long. And so my question is just about the new resources. There was comments from the pump storage developers about how PGE had treated pump storage, and I just wanted to see if I could understand a little bit better that dynamic in your latest reply. Comments like, at the end of May, there was a description that there was, in fact, like a one or two things that you had, you agreed with, maybe an error with respect to how you had modeled pump storage. And then if I understood correctly, it felt like once those errors were corrected, there was, the model was still not pointing to pump storage until after 2040. So I just wanted to see if I underst understand that correctly. And then with respect to that error or that change that you made in the modeling, are any of the other new technology, emerging technologies, susceptible to that same error or modeling issue? And I'm thinking about, like, hydrogen generation projects or offshore wind or emerging battery technologies, but there'a similar dynamic with respect to those. And I may have one more follow up question, but I'll stop there for a minute. Yeah, thank you for the question. Yeah. So we think the error was just in our characterization of the pump storage resource, because we've never had it on our system. We lumped it for convenience, probably with an oversight that, you know, it would be considered an emerging resource. It's not. It's been out in the market. We've never had it. So that's why we put it there. And we limited some information that was provided for other capacity resources. We didn't include pump storage in the tables just because we weren't seeing it in the preferred portfolio. So that's definitely a mistake on our part, because it is a mature technology and it is available commercially and it should be an option for us. So we included the information we think we omitted. And looking at the portfolio analysis, we've taken a couple high level passes, and we don't think anything would change based off of inclusion of the pump storage resource versus other resources out there. That oversight, I don't think, carries through to those emerging technologies. So hydrogen, offshore wind, I don't think we made any mischaracterization similar to the pump storage resource. And so that's pretty regrettable that in that throughout the docket, we're able to provide more clarity on what the pump storage resource does and doesn't do and what it possibly could add to the system. Okay, thanks. And you already kind of touched on the last question I had, which was just trying to help understand the significance of characterizing something as an emerging resource. Does that just mean that it's, you know, highly uncertain with respect to cost and availability, or does it do something else",

        "text": " public comment here, so I'm just going to go go there now. Probably just ask people to raise their hands. I know the company is on the line too. I'd be inclined to save comment from the company until we hear any other public comment. So we got one hand now. So we'll start there with Jack Watson for Osea. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Chairared Decker, commissioners Tawy and Perkins. For the record, my name is Jack Watson speaking on behalf of theegon Solared Storage Industries association. First, I'd like to begin by covering two issues relating to the legacy date and retaining legacy status. Oo continues to request that the legacy date be set as the date of the commission's order instead of the date Idaho power filed in their February request. Idaho Power claims that the cutoff date of February 29, 2024 was set to avoid a run on solar development. And throughout this process and during the workshop, we've inquired about whether there's been any increase in applications. Their response is that it's been a fairly regular continuation of what existed before and not a run on solar development, and so we feel the legacy date should be set as the date of the order as a good policy making practice. Second, the legacy issue relating to the six month offline period before losing legacy status, I'd like to highlight the comments by EGT solar that point out the many reasons that this will be extremely difficult for customers to ensure they are able to get their system online within the 6th month period, as legacy customers may not even realize their system is online offline unless they're closely monitoring their bill. Additionally, supply chain constraints are hindering installers s ability to get all sorts of equipment, which may be even more difficult for older systems that require parts to be special ordered from abroad. This is the change that the commission could make here without changing the costs associated with the program. We think this practical change to reflect the changing installer environment would be beneficial to customers who have made an investment in their own resiliency and energy independence. Next, I'd like to discuss ORS 757.30 on section nine. OCA agrees with staff that Idaho Power's proposal doesn't meet the requirements of the statute and cannot satisfy the section nine exception. In terms of the section six analysis, OA recognizes that Idaho Powersegon service territory is unique from other investor owned utilities in the state, and we agree with staff that the program structure, compensation framework, and application of public policy and environmental considerations in this docket should not be interpreted as presidentcedial, if anothergo organ utility were to proposed changes to their net metering offering. However, OA still feels that Idaho powers analysis under section six is insufficient to justify departure from the net metering program prescribed by statute. There's been a no analysis on the part of Idaho Power on the effects of their new program on low and moderate income households, which make up most of Idaho Power's Oregon service territory. While solar for all funds will help bring solar and storage to low income and disadvantaged communities in Oregon, those funds were intended to propel existing programs forward. Now that Oregon's been awarded that grant money, changes to programs that were intended to be propelled forward are now going to have less of an impact. So in Idaho Powers service territory, what would have gotten more systems installed for those customers is going to result in less systems because they're going to have to build more expensive systems. And lastly, OA agrees with staff that there is environmental and customer value to on site generation. However, as we had discussed in our comments and comments from other stakeholders, we do not feel that Idaho Power correctly value the environmental benefits in their study. There are still valid concerns that remain about the methodology and environmental values, and we appreciate staff's recommendation that these issues potentially be revisited in any future net metering investigation. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments today, and I'll remain on to answer any questions. Thanks for your comments. Any questions for Jack? Yeah, real quick, Jack, can you talk a little more about the what you think is more reasonable? What I see is putting forward is a more reasonable offline clause. Yeah, so I think a year would be a more reasonable time. Frme if you look at the EGT comments from an installer working in the Idaho Power service territory, a lot of these customers have auto pay on, so you're not even going to have any way to know your system is offline until you've noticed a change in your bill. And then additionally, there's all the issues associated with installers not working on other installers equipment for warranty issues. So even if you find out your system is offline within three months, if your installer is out of business, you're going to have to find somebody willing to work on that system. And if it's an older system, you're going to have to special order parts. Because this is a constantly evolving area. The technology is changing rapidly. So something that was installed ten",

        "text": " you guys think about that, too. So, Josh, what I hear is, and correct me if Im wrong, is that its almost as if theres anyone in the queue that they can't resize. Well, yeah. To avoid an upgrade. That would be the case, yeah. Because if they're making a 10% reduction, it's a pretty small change, and somebody else in the quue is likely going to overcome that. They're going to be that 10% or larger difference. They're going to cause the upgrade that the person reducing is avoiding. That would be my perspective on the issue. See, Yoki, you have your hand up. Yeah. And I guess the point I was trying to make is that from a fairness perspective, I don't know that it's a problem to impact a lower queued project if the lower queued project hasn't begun the study process, because then they don't have a definitive statement of the cost and it won't impact, it won't cause the utility to need to restart the study process in any way. Sure. And so I think because they like, like conceptually with the serial ceue, because they are a higher queued process, they have a right to that capacity before the lower QE project. Sure. All right. Okay. Thanks everybody. We'move on to the highlight, perhaps this is the current definitions include both distributed energy resource and small generator facility. There's a couple different things here. The distributed energy resource brings in storage, which is, you know, that's what we're looking for here. There's an issue, though, that Irex definition includes interconnection facilities. Oregon small generator facility definition excludes interconnection facilities. So the question is, should we go with one term over the other? And what issues are we creating or re solving here? So I'll s kind of throw it open for discussion here. And Ted, I could prompt like Yoki, I think it would be helpful to just get a reiteration on your end of whether the intent is for DER to replace small generator facility, and then it can encompass with the expectation that we combine behind the meter projects into, or net metering projects into one single sub der interconnection rules. Is that your intent, or is it intended to be used like it's a subset of small generators, or small generators are a subset of DERs, and they are need to be tactically like, the term needs to be tactically used in different parts of the rules. So the batteries toolkit recommends having one defined term for what the rules are applicable to and then using that single term consistently throughout the rules. Our recommendation would be to use DER and then get rid of the term small generator facility. But, you know, some states have kind of taken another approach, which is to change the definition of small generator facility to include so that it encompasses energy storage systems. I think that either could work, but I would definitely. I would recommend only using one term. I think that that makes the rules cleaner and clearer. U and u, in my opinion. It's, you know, if you're. It's kind of weird to use small generator facility because if you look at kind of the dictionary definition of generator that does not include a battery. But this wouldn't be the, if you decide to go that way and include battery, you know, include batteries within the definition of small generator facility, it wouldn't be the first time that a statute or rule has a definition that doesn't match a dictionary definition. So it's, that's okay. But, yeah, I would definitely recommend only using one of the two and then doing it consistently throughout. Go ahead, Adam. Yeah, thanks. Ted, can you hear me okay? Yes, I can. All right. I guess from the joint utility perspective, I think we would generally agree that using one term is probably preferable, just to avoid confusion down the road. I think from our perspective, you were posing more of a substantive question, less about whether we call it a veer or a small generator, but really ##ation whether the definition encompasses interconnection facilities or not. And I would say from our sort of initial review of the rules and subject to additional review down the road, there are some problems. I think if we were to adopt the DER definition sort of as written, which is inclusive of interconnection facilities, and then just, you know, sort of do a find and replace type of exercise. You know, there are certainly rules elsewhere in division 82 where it talks about small generator facilities and interconnection facilities in the same world in a way that if you just replace small generator facility with DER, that rule now is subject to confusion because it's referencing interconnection facilities which are also embedded within the definition of DER. And it's possible that that's simply going to create confusion. But I think, as we do a closer read, there could be places where that could create substantive issues as well. And again, we're in the process",

We are following up from a public meeting that we held last Thursday in which we heard hours of public comment, comment from staff and from the company, and in which we were able to dialogue with all of those participants about the extensive written comments that have been filed over the last six months or so on Northwest Natural's integrated resource plan. We concluded that public meeting without beginning our deliberation so that we could consider that dialogue and those comments more fully in arriving at our decision today will be primarily focused on us arriving at our decision. I think we indicated last week that there would be an opportunity for commissioners to ask follow up questions to staff or the company or anyone else who filed comments and decided to join this meeting today. I'm not aware that we're necessarily going to start there. We may have some comments or, sorry, some questions and clarifications as we work through all of the recommendations. But I guess I just wanted to pause there and confirm with my fellow commissioners that there aren't sort of big picture topics that you wanted to dig back into following last week's discussion. No, I think that's right. I think, I think that we would be better served to start into some deliberations just to hear where each other is at, at kind of a high level. I expect there'll be tons of questions as we go throughout the day, and I think we're probably in for a pretty long meeting to kind of work through all these things today. But I agree with you. I don't want to start out with more questions. I feel like we got through most everything that we needed to start deliberations at the last meeting. Wonderful. Sounds like. Looks like Commissioner Tawy agrees. Thank you. I want to reinforce something that Commissioner Thompson just said as we get started here, which is over the last six months or longer. All of these stakeholders, staff, the company, members of the public, and other organized groups have been working together on this. The commissioners and I have been working kind side by side on this, other than what we've heard each other say in workshops or otherwise. This is our first opportunity to talk together about the particular issues raised in this IRP because IRP are processed as open public meeting items, and so we need to have our deliberations in public, and so that is what we're doing. And I always like to explain that at the outset so that you, those who may be new to the process, have a sense of why it might take us so long to talk through these things. We will move as expeditiously as we can with attention to some completeness in covering at least all of the staff recommendations and other concrete recommendations that others have provided. Our administrative law judge, Sarah Spruce, who folks saw on last Thursday's meeting, will help us make sure that we've covered to the extent we need to, the various staff recommendations. But we're going to structure today's discussion a little more broadly than just walking through those by number. We'll share some perspectives broadly on the IRP to open then. I guess my intention is that we'll talk through some of the system supply resources. We'll talk through the climate protection program and RNG CCI issues. After that, we'll talk through the distribution system investments and planning issues, and then we'll talk through the long term planning issues and finish with miscellaneous things that we haven't covered. We'll see how that works and whether we can really group the recommendations that we're seeing under those categories. But just so people have a sense of what I'm thinking in terms of subject areas, subject to change as we get going through this. Commissioners, any comments on just our program here today? If not, I'm happy to start with some overall remarks, but I'm also happy to defer to one of you if you'd prefer to begin that big picture discussion yourself, thoughts about the process or how we start. Sounds like a really good plan for the day and im'm happy to defer to you chair to offer your thoughts. I would just add a real thanks to the stakeholders who'engaged in this process and provided so much content and stuck with us through a long meeting last week answering our questions and sharing your views. Really appreciated that input and what it gave us to think over in the intervening times. Otherwise, take it away. Chair great. Okay, well, I have a few big picture thoughts that I think will be helpful to understanding how I'm coming at some of the more specific issues here. First thing I want to say is that consistent with how we approached the UM 21 78, the natural gas fact funding, we're really trying to approach a lot of big picture uncertainty and anxiety by working through some concrete issues in real dockets.",

        "text": " intend to procure such. So those supply curves which PGE's model is based on are also then demonstrably inaccurate and probably over assuming the constructed supply that will be built in the northwest by 20 or 30,000 additional generation, which is then further constrained by the inability of the transmission system to support additional delivery, especially the Portland system. And we have now the Bonneville TP report from the last study, which establishes essentially a litany of ten to 20 year new wires projects that are required to additional deliver new transmission to Bonneville system also, which is not accounted for and effectively makes non viable the additional resources that have been, you know, that might be made available to Portland s system. And also those transmission costs are not being priced as well, to our understanding. I do also do not believe that, for example, PGE'construction builds for the upgrades of their system and the Bonneville interface and so forth are being reflected either. In that. On top of that, I guess moving to the battery issue, as I brought up before, we have this sort of arbitrary, UNSC scrutinized assumption that four hour batteries are magically going to be appointed by PGE. While there may be some nominal sense to that, and it hasn't been substantiated and developed, nor the cost, and I believe we've seen numbers on the order of like $18 a kilowatt month in some recent other meetings and filings which we could follow up on. But I think it's pretty clear that those revenues are not embedded in the capacity contributions and capacity payments that a QF would benefit from in any of the scenarios that PG has filed for solar baseload or solar plus storage. So, you know, I think that's a basic reference point for the revenue for just the capacity contribution that should be embedded and checked and validated in that regard, in terms of avoided resources which might exist, the last known, clear avoided resource that has been bid, you know, making transparent that new, so'bids into the last RFP, where the second place bids. We know that those prices were once viable and there were essentially fully executed contracts, and there's essentially fully negotiated contracts that were functionally available and bid in, subject to some price adjustments for some tariff issues that were there. It's not clear to me whether the IE, scoring and documentation to the commission about our final negotiated prices were actually included in those reports or not, because we've not be able to get answers to that question because the prices evolved after the final shortlist, including based on a variety of things going on in the market and PGE's solicitation of price increases from us. But effectively, that second place thing that wasn't selected would have been what could have occurred. That said, I also want to make clear that Nuun, as a result of the RFP design framework, did not bid in the current RFP, and so none of those resources are being made available to Portland general at this point going forward. Based on the transmission situation, it's extremely unclear to me what can actually be built and delivered, except for that the numbers in these models, across a number of points, are demonstrably inaccurate and not defensible, and thus not the appropriate avoided costs, and thus something must be done to further these issues. I'happy. To discuss some recommendations on that point, but I'll pause there and hope you'll provide some opportunity for back and forth on these issues. Yeah, did you want Marie to have a chance to speak too? Because I, I want to make sure we're being sort of equitable in time, or like to take questions. Marie, do you want to callor in on that or any other issues that we've been tracking? Yes. Thank you, chair Decker and commissioners Tani and Perkins. Marie Barlow, on behalf of NAN Energy, I did just have some brief comments on process concerns that NAN has raised in the past, but I'll raise again here for your consideration in this context, which is under the commission Rule 860-029-0080 sub three, each public utility must file with the commission draft avoided cost information at the time it files its integrated resource plan, and file final avoided cost information within 30 days of a commission decision of acknowledgement. And the way I've always read that is that they need to file it in the same format that they would file it when they eventually request this avoided cost update, and that the intent of that provision is to provide parties with information about what avoided costs would look like based on the assumptions and inputs that PGE has used in the IRP, which you know, inevitably feeds into these avoided costs. And PGE has responded in the IRP context, that they interpret this to provision to mean that we need to go dig through all of their work, paapers in the IRP, to find all of the inputs that would go into their model. And that's an incredible burden to put on stakeholders. And",

And really particularly on the CBR side, CBR eas side, you know, find where are the values that we can bring to those individual communities as cheaply as possible and give them resilience and that sustainability goals that they're trying to meet. So Randy, you want to jump to the next slide? Yes. Thank you. So continuing in the discussion of the action plan on slide 28, we have some additional items from the IRP and CEP. To an extent, some of these items review things already discussed and include the completion of the 2022 request for proposals, conducting the 2023 24 request for proposals. Also as mentioned, evaluating criteria for a small scale renewable RFP, expanding transmission capacity in the west, developing operational procedures to meet emission requirements until 2040, while importantly pursuing non emitting technologies and the continued development of an alleation, excuse me, allocation methodology that provides options to meet each state's energy policy and, as Zapir underscored, while maintaining the benefits of the system and negotiating all of those interactions. And then that takes us to the last slide, please, which discusses procurement. So, expanding on the 2023 24 all source RFP, we note that it aligns with the needs identified in the 2023 IRP, and it's designed to acquire and evaluate specific energy supply resources through the end of 2028. The utility scale RFP timeframe aligns with those needs for the small scale. We anticipate issuing an RFP with bids due late in 2024 or early 2025 to find those 490 mw that we're currently projecting. But we may need to advance the timing as we continue to evaluate and noting again that, you know, beneficial economic resources and the relative merits of accelerated versus a decelerated acquisition are gonna be evaluated pretty much every step of the way. And Pacific Corps would also like to note and encourage developers to begin the process to identify interconnection costs for projects. Pacific Cores generator interconnection cluster study participation window is. Let's see, what did we say? Sorry. Is available from April 1 to May 15, 2024. So we would recommend getting to that sooner rather than later. Any questions? Yeah, Randy, I don't know that this is a fair question to ask you, so let's call it an observation or something to follow up on. But I guess the question maybe is, does are you expecting to see small scale renewables participating in Pacific Corpse cluster study along the same terms and conditions and pathways that the large scale resources are all I. On the one hand, we're saying we're going to do this RFP and we need x megawatts of small scale resources, which obviously I have some questions about. But on the other hand, what I often hear is nothing is moving on the distribution scale interconnection. The simple answer is yes. One of the difficulties is that for small scale projects, typically, and by the way, I'm no subject matter expert, so loosely speaking, there are requirements for requirements, for example, that need to be met that typically a small scale project may not have been subject to or eager to get into. I do know that we have an intent to pursue the small scale renewables actively. It's difficult to say what the response might look like or how much difficulty we will have and, you know, receiving bids for projects that work that, that are compliant and do what they need to do, but we are certainly, you know, actively interested in making that happen. And I think that the small scale RFP is going to reflect that. One thing that we have talked about with staff and stakeholders that is of note is that, you know, we have not been receiving a bunch of small scale project bids, even though we have been open to them. And that's one of the reasons why we want to focus particular attention on how to get that done, to get as robust a response as we can manage. Yeah, I think one of the things to explore is going to be the disconnect between, hey, we really want you to come and participate in our RFP and we are going to actively address barriers to interconnection or whatever other barriers of small scale resources. Again, something to explore going forward and appreciate what Joel is saying about many moving interconnected pieces here, but I know that'be a question. Thanks. If I could just pile on their chair. I noted the mention of energy trust earlier in the slides around the resilience partnership. You know, thinking about ETO in terms of the community based renewable energy, I think you would find ETO profound partner in understanding those barriers and figuring out how to really enable the developer community, like the irrigation districts and some of the, some of the folks who do renewables development as a side",

There's an evidentiary hearing scheduled for October 10. Oral arguments from the parties are scheduled for November 14. The commission anticipates issuing a final order in this docket by December 20, and any new rates will become effective on January 1, 2025. Let's go to the next slide. Any members of the public who wish to comment but cannot do so this evening may submit written comments via our website, by email or by mail, or by calling consumer services as shown on this slide and on our website. Please include an attention line that identifies the docket as UE 435. Members of the public may request an interpreter at that time that they call and will be connected to an interpreter to the extent that one is available for their language. PUC Consumer Services representatives will provide a summary of any comments received to staff and staff will provide an overview of any comments received by June 14, 2024. As part of its opening testimony, I will now turn things over to Melissa Nottingham with commission staff for a brief presentation. Thank you. Good evening. My name is Melissa Nottingham and I'm the manager of consumer services at the Public Utility Commission. Part of my role is to gather comments. Tonight I will be providing a high level overview of Portland General Electric'General, Ra case and the potential impact to residential customers. Please note the information provided is the company's proposal and does not necessarily reflect the final decision. As part of the process, staff will be reviewing the company's request to ensure it is reasonable and necessary for providing safe and reliable electric service to Orgonians. Next slide please. General RA Rate case impact base rates Portland's rate case includes the following capital investment, which includes new facilities upgrading existing facilities and other grid modernizations operation and maintenance costs, which are the day to day running operational costs of the company. The cost of capital, which is the cost of financing issuing debt, includes return on equity and taxes. Next slide please. The company is asking for a $202 million increase to base rates, representing a 7.3% increase effective on January 1, 2025. The impact of the rate increase will vary across customer classes. This table demonstrates the impact on residential customers. Residential includes both single family and multifily homes using an average kilowatt hour usage for each type of service. The approximate increase is 6.4 for single family homes and 6.9 for multif family homes. It's important to note that the percentage of increase will vary depending on how much power or kilowatt hours used by the customer. Next slide please. So what is driving what are the cost drivers? The largest bucket at 58%, are capital projects. This includes two battery storage facilities, which will allow the company to meet peak customer loads and also ongoing investment in transmission and distribution projects for reliability and resiliency. The second largest bucket at 26% is increase in operational maintenance costs. And to offset the total impact of the price increase, the company is proposing to reduce revenue requirements by 18.1 million, which includes eliminating theortions of incentives, reduced labor costs and other reductions of operational costs. Next slide Please rate cases are complex. To review Portland General's proposal, the public utility Commission employs experts from a variety of areas. The company must demonstrate their spending is necessary, prudent and reasonable staff'responsibility. Encompasses a range of tasks from technical analysis, economic review, risk analysis and then how are those costs going to be distributed among different types of customers? To do this analysis, a team of accountants, financial specialists, economists and engineers are employed to make sure the projects forecasts and the models used by the company are reasonable. Legal guidance is provided by the Department of Justice. Next slide, please. So what are the next steps? Rate cases are quasi judicial proceeding and are conducted in a manner similar to court proceedings which you may be familiar with. It requires preparing testimony, a discovery process with data requests, rebuttal testimony, settlement talks, etcetera. Staff has already begun this process by requesting additional information from the company and will be filing its opening testimony on July 15. I strongly encourage everyone to follow the docket to receive updates by going to www. Doorgon dot gov Puc. Go to the Edocts tab and follow UE 435 next slide, please. You can also feel free to contact us at Consumer services at 1805 222404 and I want to thank everyone for attending tonight and I look forward to hearing your feedback. Thank you. Thank you, Melissa. We're going to move on to the public comment portion of tonight. I'm going to go over the process briefly.

        "text": " PGE value came in after that, that meeting on April 4, so was submitt on April 9. Staff did meet with the company to discuss the value. And I guess while the company characterized it as. As incorrect, I think our, our discussion and some of the back and forth in other dockets, including um. 1728, kind of provided an insight that it wasn't just this grant pud extension contract, but really an averaging over the ELC'planning horizon that does lead to the higher value. So that was part of the reason why staff directed towards that, even though the value was corrected by the company. I'll say. And then to. To Mister Stevens comments, I think there might be a misunderstanding of what staff recommended around forward prices. So staff is recommending using basically the methodology from UM 1728 around forward prices. So the observation that staff made was that previously PG had just been using modeled outputs from Aurora for the entire planning horizon, including the near term. And as you noted, the big concern there was the gap in prices. So Aurora was putting out the really low numbers and their own operations teams were forecasting the higher values. I guess then transitioning into this question of capacity, staff has very much been clear that this is a phase one investigation, and we'll be launching phase two shortly after this part of the order that just came out of lc 80, as well as direction for PGE to help by contributing a new methodology, new proposal for energy efficiency, avoided costs. So that's something that staff looks forward to continuing to explore. All these questions, ELCC, whether the four hour battery is the sole resource over the horizon, or just the one used now. So I think maybe it's accurate to say that this is a. We do think we're moving directionally in the right way, but there's a lot more to explore. And staff is aware of the ongoing conversations in the, um. 2000 suite of dockets, including 1728. And we've been coordinating with staff there as well, to make sure we're aligning as best as we can. Thank you, Peter. Let me just clarify. So from your point of view, we have to set avoid cost values every year. It's just part of getting the energy trust budget process going to get energy efficiency out there. So this is not whether I'm thinking about it from the comments PGE made, or from the comments that Jake Stevens made precedial, whether here or in any other application for avoided cost concepts. You actually intentionally are saying that you're going to be examining this before the next cycle. Is that fair? Yes, that's correct. Thank you. Thanks. Other questions for Peter. I have the benefit of getting closer to this process over the last several years. This is a process we do every year. I wonder if it would help, folks, if you could sort of remind us where we are in this process that we chose to postpone this update until after the IRPs. Normally, we would have done this actually, six months ago, sort of. You kind of lay out a little bit of the bigger picture of the process and why this is a phase one update. I think I'm a little closer to it, but I wonder if that would be helpful to articulate. Yeah. Thanks, Commissioner Tani. Absolutely. So the typical cadence for the, um, 18 893 docket is that there's an October 15 deadline by which utilities have to submit data, and then the commission has 60 days to consider approval of those data. And so that puts an end of year timeline on approving avoided costs that get used not in that following year, but the year beyond that. So in light of the passage of HP 2021 and both PG and Pacificoree creating irps and cps that responded to that legislation in 2023, staff saw some values that didn't really align with the direction that was shown in those irps. And so that's when we requested the commission waived that October 15 filing deadline, push it into 2024, when we had more time and clarity to consider those inputs. And then the other thing we committed to at that same time was having 2024 operate as a two phase. I guess the docket would happen in two phases. The first phase would be just that, more operational, get updated, avoided costs through, while considering some of these questions that got raised through the irps. And then phase two would launch with the more in depth look to the policy and and methodological components of the docket, acknowledging that there wouldn't be enough time to get those done in phase one because phase one will be used for 2025 planning, whereas phase two will inform 2026 budgets and planning for energy trust. Thanks for that. I think it's helpful to remind ourselves how we have to continue to turn this crank and also catch the prices up. So thank you for walking us through that",

I am, for the record, I'm the vice president of energy supply management for Pacific Corp. And thank you chair Decker and Commissioner Tani, Commissioner Thompson, for having us today. We're excited to be here. As you're aware, at the end of last year, we announced our intention to join the extended day ahead market being offered by the California ISO. And really, our ability to do that is based on the evidence and the success of the WEIM. And as you are all well aware, the EIM has provided $3.4 billion of customer benefits since inception. 591 millionars of that has gone directly to Pacific Corps customers from our participation in that market. In addition to just the pure economic benefits that EIMs provided, weve been able to reduce emissions by integrating more renewables onto the system than would otherwise be possible and also reduce curtailments of those renewables. And in addition to that, one thing that we dont talk enough about is the reliability that weve seen from participating in the market in that greater coordination and automatic dispatch that that we have because of EIM. So it stands to reason that if we can unlock that great amount of benefits by simply optimizing the sub hourly imbalances in the market that we can unlock even greater benefits at a greater scale by optimizing day ahead schedules that include all of transmission generation and our load. And so with that, Pacific Cor is eager to, especially in this environment with rising cost pressures in our net power cost and seeing scarcity in the market, we've been eager to build upon that existing and known success of EIM and protect the integrity of EIM and hopefully build that success of Edam just like we did with EIM and see greater participation. But besides just kind of that logical step of unlocking greater benefits, we also contracted with the brattle group recently and with me I have Hanas Penberger and I'll let him introduce himself to run assimilation, an Edam simulation. And we think this study kind of shows the benefits that we knew were there. And one of the key differences in this study, in some of the other studies that are out there is it really does a good job of modeling the Edam design based on that final market design that was published. But I won't steal any more of Hanness'thunder, and ill ll turn it over to him to go through the study that the Brato group has performed for us. Thank you Mike. As Mike said, I'm Hannesfiefenberger. I'm a principal at the bridle group. I'm based in our Boston office, but I've been doing a lot of work out in the west for Eim and the various western markets efforts. Thank you for inviting us to give me this opportunity to talk about our study. I will try to get through this pretty quickly. There are a lot of slides on study assumptions. We'll be only covering them in cursory fashion. I'll give you a brief summary, go through study assumptions, then focus on the Edam white results that we have, and then at the end end with specific or specific results. And if you have any questions on any of the slides, please speak up. I'm happy to answer those questions as there eyes. Next slide, please.",

        "text": " make some comments. Greg, go ahead. Please raise your hand if you also would like to make comments. Good afternoon. Yes, Greg Adams here on behalf of the Community Renewable Energy Association Korea. We did file some written joint comments also with Renewable energy coalition. I believe Joni Slageger may also be on this call, but I don't know that she's I don't think she's plan to say anything and I should be able to answer any questions you might have. But just a recap of our proposal. As Ryan just as detailed, we do strongly recommend that the commission implement a standard solar plus storage rate in Idaho powers rate schedules, subject to further review and approval in this docket or in the alternative and recognition of SAS recommendation to develop a rate along those lines with all three utilities and to work towards doing that for the May 1 update. We recommend that the commission at least provide some clear direction that it would like to see that such a rate be developed by staff and the utilities and other stakeholders, and make sure that approval of an IRP based rate at this time does not prejudice adoption of such a standard solar plus storage rate before the next IRP cycle so that we get delayed a few years. Some of the key points I think that we laid out in our comments, and this is similar to points that we've made, I think in some other pleadings recently and the commission'aware, that sandalone solar capacity contribution values have gone down significantly and we've seen a corresponding drop in a standard solar rates in case idtah h have power. We didn't see any standard solar ppas that have been signed in the last four years, and that's concerning. But if you look at Idaho powers IRP, similar to some of the other utilities like I'certain Pacific Corps, there is a capacity contribution value calculated there for solar plus storage facilities and it's quite high. With just adding 4 hours storage, you get a 97% contribution value. In our view, solar plus storage is now an established resource type and there should be a standard rate for it. As we pointed out, they do have a standard rate in Idaho. For Idaho power at the Idaho PUCC, we've also found precedent for something along those lines from North Carolina, so we don't see any reason why this shouldn't be a priority to put something like this in place in Oregon. Also, Idaho power and staff state that small qf can negotiate a non standard rate if they want, but in ARG view that kind of defeats the whole policy the commission has here. For standard rates, small qs are going to face difficulty negotiating that rate, and I'm not aware of that having happened for a small or even a large QF, and certainly not with compensation that we would, we would consider to be what's necessary to actually, and justify to actually encourage those facilities. So in some, in our views, information exists to do this today in the IRP. It's not, we don't think it would actually be that hard to do, and we think the commission should order that it be done at this time. But at the minimum, we urge the commission to make sure that it's clear there's an expectation'all of such a rate in the near term, and that approving these rates here today wouldn't prejudice doing so as soon as, as possible. And I can answer any questions you might have about our comments. Thanks. Thank you, Greg, and certainly appreciate Prya's position, including both the urgency but also the recognition that sense of priority from the commission is part of what you're looking for, as opposed necessarily to the Doockket being the right place to do it. Any questions for Greg? I see we have Joni, Adam and Jake also wanting to comment questionsay. Thank you, Greg. Let's go to Joni Slageger, who, as Greg said, is appearing on behalf of renewable energy coalition. Go ahead. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, chair Decker, Commissioner Tani, Commissioner Thompson, I will be very quick. As Greg mentioned, we jointly fil comments and concur with everything Mister Adam said today. I am also available if you have questions. Thank you. Great. I think probably no questions. We can always come back if there are. Let's go to Adam Laney. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, chair Decker, Commissioner Thompson and Commissioner Tanei. On behalf of Idaho Power, I just wanted to first express our thanks for staff for reviewing the updated avoided cost filing. As we noted in our comments filed this morning, we support staff's recommendation to approve the rates as filed. We also support staff's recommendation to not use this docket and the post IRP update to create a new avoided cost methodology. We think it's far outside the scope of this update docket. We agree it's appropriately resolved in, uM, 2000, where the commission is taking a more holistic approach out Avo cost methodologies. The one substantive observation I will add",

        "text": " manageable. The cost differential was pretty manageable. An alternative, then, to keep Valmy running on coal like all of that is predicated on the idea that VM on coal is not an option post 2025 ish. Am I remembering? Nb is. There's a. There's a reason why 2025 was sort of the horizon for Valy Cole. All me running on coal. The plan was to, for both Idaho power and NV energy to shut down the plant from coal operations at the end of 2025. That's right. And so NV Energy has identified the need to keep that as well. And they have filings with their Nevada commission to convert to gas. And so really, it's us continuing or. Yeah, it's us. Us moving forward with gas, with them and that unit conversion, or they would likely take over the entire plant. I see. So they are likely to continue to use Valmy either way because of their resource position. But you're finding in your modeling, it's cost effective for you to join in that conversion because in part because it fills this capacity gap, but also going forward beyond this one year. That's right. Yeah. Especially the winter needs that Jared had shown earlier. Those are starting to materialize to the point where having this kind of flexible resource that is already steel on the ground and can be used at a lower capacity factor to just help us get over those shorter peaks and meet the winter needs when we're not seeing the renewables generating at certain times of the year, you know, like low, lower Sundays, lower wind days, it's a really good reliability resource to help us and. Yeah, very cost effective. And I'm curious how. And this isn't something we have to get into in a lot of detail here, but given the constraints we've seen for natural gas along the west coast, you know, it'll be really interesting to understand the how sort of extreme a band you tested in your gas price, gas price modeling. Rightas as these conversions happen, we're seeing gas constraints emerge across the west coast. And so understanding how you modeld that volatility of gas price will be important. Yeah, that's a good question. And we do have some stochastic looks at our various gas price futures here in a few slides, but we can dig into that a little bit more. Yeah. Or it s something I can go back and look at. We don't have to spend a lot of time on it. Thanks. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. And so this slide represents our action plan. So if you click one more time, Jared, we, the. We've tried to separate our action plan into decisions that have already been made. And so that's what the yellow boxes that we have around these various resources. And so next year, our intention or plan is to install about 100 solar 96 storage, and before the summer of next year, convert Bridger units one and two from coal to gas, and continue with our energy efficiency optimizations, adding about 95 that over the course of 24 through 2028. And then in 2025, we would look to add 200 solar and. And 227 storage to meet our needs between those two years. So those decisions we've already made and executed contracts on. So they were base assumptions in the entire IRP or in all scenarios. And then as we're moving forward, the top one is the Swift north project. We didn't. We talked about that a little bit in the IRP, but we didn't go into a lot of analysis in it. And so we're continuing to explore that as an ongoing effort over the next short term here, looking to make a decision on that one. And then we are seeing long duration energy storage identified in the. So we would like to proceed or look to enact a pilot project for a smaller amount of that capacity. We think that that would be really good for us to get in there and get our hands kind of dirty and working with that type of asset and learn how to utilize it and optimize around it before we jump in feet first into like, 100 plus megawatt type of asset. And we're thinking that particularly on lead times right now, it takes a fair amount of time to start an RFP process and then a get a resource actually online, that if we brought a project like this online in like, 2026, and gave ourselves a year or two to learn and consider how it would fit within all of our portfolio by, like, say, the end of 27, it would be probably the early 2030s before we'd be able to get a larger project. So just kind of like stringing those serial timelines along. Getting a pilot project looks like it would be a pretty good approach to understanding how long duration storage would fit within the rest of our portfolio and really provide a lot of value. So that's something we'd like to pursue and looking for opportunities there and then",

        "text": " a 2030 question. It's a question of how much of that responsibility PG is going to be planning for in terms of balancing their renewables and how that will align with the DEQ reporting ruls. Some of the modeling that's happening in the different comments is I could think of it as illuminating policy questions that might not change the exact procurement strategy that's happening in real time right now, but might show us a lot about what's important to get more clear on going forward. I think if those, in a perfect world, those questions would be illuminated in time to inform the first procurement in advance of 2030. There's still time, there's still additional cycles, and hopefully additional information and better modeling will make for better procurements in the future. The questions are sort of, are they targeting the types of resources that really help them to balance their system, including things that are available during those periods. Are energy efficiency, are they getting enough energy storage? Is there renewable portfol going to be sufficiently diverse and addressr complimentary? So there are some, I guess I'm hearing you say there are somert near term. How do you target procurement issues, depending on how you think of the amount of flexibility you have with that annual netting? I think ideally ye the flip side is that there'a lot of procurement to be done, then there might be some steps that aren't perfectly optimal along that path that can still get you to a reasonable place by 2030. That's fair. Thanks. Appreciate that. Commissioners. Other questions for staff before we move on? I think we'll have to move on fairly quickly, but no. Okay. Again, a lot here that we didn't cover and appreciate just sort of helping us get our hands around some of what is there for us to consider. Thanks. We'll call up renewable northwest next, I think on the agenda. Good morning. Good morning. Chair Decker, Commissioners Tawy and Thompson. For the record, Max Green here for renewable Northwest and just wanted to start off first by thanking you for the opportunity to comment both in writing and here this morning, and also offer appreciation for the good work that PGE has done in trying to tackle this sort of ambitious, unprecedented planning effort and also the work that staff is doing to try to unpack it I thought that colloquy that commissioners had with Seditiona just now, and Elainne as well, was really excellent. Without further delay, though, il ll jump into sort of going through what I want to say. As you know, renewable Northwest worked with a number of outside experts consultants to develop our round one comments. In our written comments we identified ten discrete asks of the company and the commission today. We'd like to sort of focus in on four of them, but we are prepared, of course, to address commissioners questions on anything in our written comments. We have a number of the folks who joined us in drafting those comments here in the virtual room today. As to the four asks that we were planning to address. The first is based on modeling performed by Lance Kaufman. We recommended that PGE adopt an alternative preferred portfolio. Our recommended preferred portfolio included over a gigawatt of offshore wind by the mid two thousand thirty s and over two gigawatts by 2040. PGE didn't fully accept our proposed alternative preferred portfolio, but they did respond in their reply comments with an updated preferred portfolio that does include approximately a gigawatt of offshore wind by the mid. So while we're still reviewing the full updated preferred portfolio, we would like to sort specifically support PGE'addition of roughly a gigawatt of offshore wind by 2035 as being aligned with our analysis as to what at least cost least risk portfolio in that timeframe. Looks like. Just a couple other observations there. The change reflects the unique value of this resource, which has a generation profile that's complementary to other variable resources that are coming online in the region and appear in PGS portfolio. But perhaps more importantly, the inclusion of this resource in theferred portfolio sends an important market signal. I think that partly sort of responds to one of the questions, Chaireckr, that you were asking Sedhana about whats the actual value of the preferred portfolio in this moment? Given the flexible procurement environment, Oregon can be a difficult state to develop new resources in and the dynamics around offshore wind are especially unique. Knowing that there is an interested offtaker in the state will likely help for competitive development of this resource, so we think theres quite a bit of value there. Second, we requested a long lead RFP for resources that have had some difficulty competing or are novel in traditional rfps. PG'reply comments indicate that they are planning to issue a request for information, an RFI that may inform a future procurement strategy. We'looking forward to learning more about that planned RFI, but we do continue to believe that there would be value in a separate long lead R",

        "text": " sort of one sort of wondering about our, an Oregon specific and where the rulemaking goes. And then a couple of thoughts on the bigger scale on the Oregon front. I did read the Calpine comments. I think there's some interesting conversation going on, but the comment that Rebecca made about being concerned about disrupting sort of what the pace of contracting is because of Californias structure around RA for ESS and their deregulated structure made me really cautious, made me sort of set up a red flag for me that we are a small goldfish in a really big goldfish bowl in terms of contracting and that we need to be sort of cautious. And I wonder if there our esses, those folks in that space can sort of help us understand how we can take steps that get us, that keep us in alignment as opposed to disrupt how we think about contracting to meet loads. So it just reminded me that we were operating in this much large, larger contracting space and that I want to understand that better and im sure that folks will unpack it more through the rest of the rulemaking process. I hesitate to go so far as to say maybe theres lessons to be learned from the California RA structure, but maybe there are lessons. I dont know. We just need to not be at cross purposes with it because well lose. And then on the broader scale it'exciting to see how all of the thinking is moving forward. What I don't hear is sort of prospectively anticipating how much fossil resource is going to come off based on the policies that are already on the books. Right. Those are we, we haven't necessarily seen all the plant retirements that the policies that are on the books today are going to require. And I worry that as the picture looks to WECC right now, it's actually not captured all the fossil retirements. And I worry a lot that we don't have the structural changes to load and we don't have the impacts of extreme events. And I see some of that coming out in the scenarios. Maybe it's in there and it just, we didn't have time get into it today. But I am worried in the IRps, I'm worried in the power council'work, I'm worried across the board that we're not capturing the structural change in load as AC penetrates, as Ev's penetrate, and how are we capturing that? So just something to put a pin in. It's the kind of thing that really worries me a whole different question, whether there's actually public acceptance of a one in ten. California's know, press getting events have been one in ten and, you know, they don't seem to be politically palatable. So I think that's a different question, but one that I think the council is starting to approach with. Thinking about the fat tails that really interesting. Thanks for giving us opportunity. Wonderful. Thank you, Commissioner Thompson. Those are all really good comments. I benefited a lot from the discussion today. So thanks to all the speakers. The expertise level is really, really deep, and I've got all the information that we got from all of our presenters was just super helpful for me. So some of my takeaways I'll just share real quick. You know, this is just a reminder for me how important the topic is. We've got to do this and do it right, and at the same time, we need to control the costs. And that's what I mean when I say do it right. So I also was really impacted by that discussion about trying to make sure that we get people on the hook to think about resource adequacy and that we also have put them on a hook in a way that allows them to transact in the way that's most beneficial for customers while still taking care of the problems that are identified. So I think that's really important. And it was going to stick with me. So I guess that was actually my last point, is I appreciated staff and rap identifying that one area where we can really add value is that we can put people on the hook to respond or to act. And so if they haven't voluntarily joined the rap program, then we can require them to do something else. And, you know, I guess I'mlined to think the rap program is looking pretty attractive and is feeling a really important need in the region. And so I like the idea of directing people over to the WRP program, but at the same time really appreciate staff spending some time thinking is, is that adequate? Is there there something more that's missing? Is there more transparency that's needed or a different timef FRme and I think they're indicated they're still thinking about that and that'be an ongoing conversational with stakeholders. So all of this was really good today, and I benefited a lot. So thanks. Right. Well, not much I can add to that. I can't help, though, sitting here thinking about resource adequacy as one of, of our, if not the foundational responsibility we have for oversight as a utility commission and",

        "text": " the initial stages for figuring out how batteries work. So questions like how durable are they? How long do they last? You know, do systems work better when paired with two hour or four hour or longer duration batteries? And what's lost when batteries have smaller nameplate capacities compared to the resources they're inter connected with? So we think these are significant questions and we don't have adequate data to draw from to inform utility decision making at this point. I mean, the data we do have we think is likely to evolve over time. You know, in these unanswered questions. They're even more important under purpa where we have to establish these avoided costs for long term contracts. And you know, consider, I think, the most important example that came up from the workshops to date. Under PuRPA, utilities don't have the ability to dispatch batteries to meet system needs. On the other side, developers can't charge their batteries with grid electricity, so we don't get to dispatch them when they're needed the most and we can't charge them when we have abundant supply. So this is subopimal and I think there's fundamental concerns that limit the effectiveness of these developer charged and dispatched resources. So while the benefits of energy storage, we think will be much greater outside of the Purpa context, we strongly support staffs interim proposal. We think it's reasonable and modest and we think it will ll ensure rateayers only pay for the costs that are avoided by these resources. And we want to highlight a couple of quick examples. First, the utility modeled capacity contribution. You know, we thank staff for amending the initial procedural schedule and giving more time to investigate and present capacity contribution values for these, you know, developer charged, developer dispatched resources. These additional two and a half months will give us more time to put together a concrete proposal and just ensures that capacity contribution values are more realistic, so we thank staff for that. Next, moving to these super peak on peak hours. You know, as we noted in figure one of our April 25 comments, the existing definitions of on peak hours are stale and they just don't, they no longer reflect system realities. We just don't need capacity from eleven to 04:00 p.m. in the afternoon in any month of the year. And so our on peak hours should be updated to reflect this reality. Mean these amended definitions will align capacity payments with when we need it, and it creates strong incentives for Del the developers to deliver during these hours. And, you know, on the sub issue that we were discussing earlier in the public meeting, we strongly support staff's recommendation to allow the commission to update these on peak hours after IRP acknowledgement, even for already signed ppas. Given that ppas sign these interim rates can last for 1520 years. And given the current and future disruption in the western interconnection, you know, we want to make sure the commission has levers to pull if these on peak hours need to be adjusted and to respond to chair decker's questions from earlier. You know, this is a discretionary lever. It doesn't require the commission to adopt new on peak hour definitions, it just gives the commission the discretion to do so. So this ensures that any fact specific issues can be accounted for in later proceedings and in additionally, I'm not aware of any precedent at FERC or before state commissions that have discussed whether amending on peak hours over the course the contract is lawful under purpose or not. I tend to think it's a different issue than ensuring that qfs have price certainty on the capacity payments that they could receive because it's the same price at the date of contracting. It's just those hours of when they can achieve those prices would be amended, but I'm not aware of any precedent. Finally, the 50 megawatt cap. You know, given we're just beginning to understand how to price these resources, this is just the common sense shield. We appreciate staff for that recommendation, and I just want to wrap up with flagging one more issue. We're not asking for a commission decision on this today, but we just want to raise it for future consideration consistent with our annual may avoided cost price updates. And this is going back since at least 2018 and including in this year's filing, you know, our anticipated non renewable prices that we will include in our July 31 proposal, they'll be greater than renewable prices. And we believe this discrepancy is going to occur over the entirety of the forecasted PPA contract period. And so this just creates, you know, the wrong incentives because renewable resources could elect to receive these higher non renewable prices and, you know, retain renewable attributes associated with their generation. Understood. That's not relevant to our decision today, though. And we're kind of on a timeline here, so thank you. Any questions for Zach about the issue before us today? Okay, we got to run along here to Jimmy Lindsay for PGE, and then we'll move to deliberation. Good",

        "text": " want to really appreciate the hard work that so many advocates have put into engaging in this docket. And it's wonderful to see that growing capacity and engagement of new voices and advocacy in the IRP. I really appreciate that. That's the comments. Excellent, and I'm looking forward toing hearing more today. I think it's important to be grounded in what planning in this dynamic environment really can give us. And functionally, I think of planning as very much an adaptive management pursuit. We're trying to see what near term actions going to be resilient, be value added in a wide range of futures that we don't have good visibility into because curve balls keep coming and are going to keep coming. And we see decision points where it's time to pivot or change things. We see the signposts clearly identified that let us know a changeing of course is needed at this point or when this information becomes available. And so I think I'm looking to this planning exercise for directionality and adaptability, primarily, as opposed to any hope that a plan is going to give us a point destination out there. We're sailing an uncharted ocean here. We aren't sure where the reefs are or the islands are, and we're going to have to keep taking soundings and changing course as they on our horizons. And so that is what the planning can do. So I look forward to really engaging around the important issues that folks have raised and really echo the gravity of the cost and reliability challenge in front of us. And in addition to what you articulated, chair, highlight that we are not lone actors in this space. We in the west have always been deeply reliant on the whole western rid and interconnection and set of resources. There is no way Oregon can alone be master of its fate and no way in which we aren't impacted by pro, even in a beneficial way, and in negative ways, by the actions taken by a wide range of federal and state partners around the west. And I think we have to keep a really clear sense that we're navigating this ocean in a boat that has everyone in it. Whether we want to admit it or not, they are. We are all in this boat and we're navigating it together as I wish, wish I was queen of the world. I'not nor would I want that responsibility. But I think keeping in mind the ways in which regional actions impact us all in both good and challenging ways. So with that mindset, I'm really excited to engage the content. This is a first innovation effort and it has all of the challenges that that alpha version of something has. So really excited to engage in. How the beta version. Thanks, commissioner. Just right at the end there, we dropped your audio. I heard you say excited to hear the beta vers, how the bet version will go. But just so you know, I don't know if there's something going on with. Thank you for those remarks. Thanks to everyone for indulging us in sort of framing this exercise. I will now turn to the agenda. As folks can see, we've indicated that we'll dialogue with staff and the time is approximate, but hoping to keep that to 30 minutes and same for PGE. Then we'll move into the representatives of folks that filed written comments in the socockket. I have heard from quite a few of those have gotten in touch with the administrative hearings division. We've got Green Energy Institute, Columbia River Inter Tribal Fish Council, and we do have your request to go later in the order for critic. We have renewable Northwest, renewable energy coalition, we have citizens Utility Board, alliance of Western Energy, Consumers, Nuan Energy. Is there anyone else that filed written comments in the docket that would like to be of on the list to speak? If so, please just unmute yourself and let me know. All right, well, not hearing anyone, it's always an option to, as I said earlier, email the administrative hearings division. So we're going to move through as many conversations as we can before 1130. Sometimes in these integrated resource plans and clean energy plans, there are people that want to comment that haven't been involved in the workup of the docket throughout. Sometimes there aren't, but we tried to make it easier for people that want to address the commission that haven't been engaged in submitting written comments to speak to us. So wherever we are in the progression of dialogue with those who have filed written comments, we'll take a break and invite public comments at that time, certain of 1130, we may or may not have many of those, and if we don't, we'll shift back to anyone that we didn't finish with on the written comments, on the representative of written comments. We will take a break and resume again at the time, certain of 130. And as the agenda says, we'll be indicating the list of topics that we're going to try to go through, and we'll be directing who we want to hear from on those particular topics. That list will",

        "text": " can get their other, other work done first. And that doesn't always suit our needs and more importantly, the needs of the salmon. We won an award. It's called leap. We got a whole bunch of tech, we're getting a whole bunch of technical services from NREL. And we hope to have, I really have our feet well on the ground in about a year with NRel'assistance. And chances are this is just the beginning of a long term kind of technical capability that I foresee the commission continuing to house 'just too important for good salmon outcomes to let these issues go by. And, rob, if you don't mind, I'm going to just say a couple more things, because I think, first of all, this slide is kind of complicated, but it's also really important what's happening. What we're seeing in this model is, first, we have to remember that this is output from free from federal dams, which is really inexpensive power. But what it's showing is that the renewable resources, especially a lot of solar, is so inexpensive, and some of it priced at negative prices, that the river would actually shut down substantially to integrate that very inexpensive renewable power for salmon you think about. Again, I know the commission proably doesn't work on these issues every day, but the little salmon are migrating from their natal streams down the river, and they kind of need a flow to keep moving down the river. What you're seeing on this chart is not a flow. It's turning the river off and on several times a day, and returning adults migrate against the flow so they know which way to go. And again, if you're turning the river off and on several times a day, it makes the migration for both juvenile and adult salmon very difficult. So this is a big concern, and one of the reasons you'll see in our recommendations later, the importance of reducing peak and providing more storage so the Columbia river dams don't have to be the only battery in town. Nicely put. And maybe we should go to the next slide and we'll get to more details on peakiness and our concerns. Just a few minutes. I mentioned this earlier, but we've been making progress and rebuilding salmon runs. This is one of Asia's favorite slides. If she would hear, if she was here, she would talk about this at some length. But we're so far away from historic numbers that we have a huge mission ahead of us collectively in the region to return salmon and steelhead populations to even the modest goal that the power council has adopted. So let's go to the next slide. And when we were writing the 2001 energy vision, we looked at the amount of time, the number of hours in a year that where the top, say, 5% of peak loads, when the top 5% of peak loads occur. It was, to me, astonishing that the number of hours were very small. And yet Tom Foley, who was an economist with the power Cons council super Br Guy, painted this picture for us how expensive it is to serve those hours, that we're spending billions of dollars on steel in the ground, so to speak, to maintain energy services that people have grown accustomed to. And Tom's argument was, there's cheaper ways of doing this. And from a tribal standpoint, each of our member tribes, particularly warm spring Jiaman and Uttila, had very large transmission lines that cross their reservations. They're aware of the transmission issues, and we think that the recommendations in the energy vision, if they're implemented and reduce the demand for new transmission, there will be a need for new transmission. Our member tribes may participate in some of that development, but a large build out of new corridors could have huge impacts on tribal resources. Let's go to the next slide. And I think this was mine. So we've talked about some of these things, and this theme of taking the burden of energy production off the backs of salmon has been a consistent theme in each of our energy visions and was really brought to our attention in 2001 when, as Ed said, Bonnevill got in trouble. Let's go to the next slide. And again, trying to boil down these recommendations, and we happy to answer any questions, but a number of them relate to reducing greenhouse gas pollution. And we still think, we think that energy efficiency is really one of the top ways to do that to try to avoid the devastating effects we're facing. We're convinced because it sa, it's a proven resource, saved consumers over $70 billion, and as far as we can tell, it's positive for fish and wildlife because these savings tend to provide the most savings during peak times, winter and summer. And they don't involve steel on the ground. They don't involve changes in river flows. They have positive effects for fish and wildlife. So it has that advantage as well. And then in terms of renewable resources, if they're in combination with batteries or other storage and electrical load management,",

        "text": " year with spending level, including estimated cost and units. And this is by expense and capital investment types. Again providing a bit more detail around the emergency respons command structure, how it basically gets ramped up until you, when you've called an incident command or when you've activated nims or the incident command system, identifying interactions with public safety partners, including that frequency and the messaging that's been determined to be best in their communities. Also the leveraging of community based organizations and what has been beneficial for the communities that that PGE serves. Further discussion about the pilot battery program that PGE has engaged in and how both vulnerable customers and others can benefit from those types of resources. Detailing more general trends observed with the customer outreach metrics that they discuss in their plan. Providing more information about how inspection and vegetation management programs are conducted both inside and outside the fire risk area. So maybe getting a little bit more clarity about the deployment of those important efforts. And as with the other two, continuing to advance the use of ignition risk drivers, outages, et cetera, against mitigation measures. And, you know, basically how they're taking that lesson. Learn information and evolving the program and then technology, and including information about how advancing technology is changing their wildfire mitigation planning efforts in this update, and then 26 through 28, very similar. It's granular level of detail of wildfire risk of assets across the system, identification of risk spend efficiency or the risk quantification method that shows optimal reduction of wildfire risk for the cost and time of that effort, detailing what those measures are and the estimation of the reduced risk after they are deployed, and then continuing to advance the coordination, communication with public safety partners, communities and customers, and further discussion about the maturation of technology within the company that will mitigate risk. So that takes us to the end of the staff memo piece. I did want to take a moment to ask Melissa Sempr if she wanted to offer any information regarding the process that might be helpful to set the framework for any questions that you all might have before any further comments. Sure. Thank you, Heidi. Oh goodness. Can you all hear me? It looks like I might have frozen. Okay. Oh, there we go. Okay, I'm back. Thank you. Wanted to just say hello. Thank you for having me. I wanted to thank you for trusting me and inviting me into your process and just say how clear it is, how hard everyone is working and how impressed I am by the, at the level of collaboration and thought and just hard work that's gone into all of the plans and the evaluations of the plan. So thank you again for inviting me to your process. Just to set a little context of why and where I was coming from and why I think it's so important. The steps that you all are considering taking here today, these are thorny, thorny problems. And it is, is incredibly difficult to be essentially in an emergency response place and then also simultaneously trying to build a framework in a system so that you have transparency and that decisions are rooted and grounded in data, and that everyone can understand that when a utility is selecting a particular mitigation, it's based off of a really deep understanding of risk on their system and that they've waight alternatives and that they've ultimately selected the most cost effective, best bang for your buck way of putting it, mitigation going forward. And I'll just say, nobody has this figured out. I am bringing to the table my experience in California, which is just a few years ahead of everyone else, but still grappling with all of the same issues that are being grappled with here in Oregon. And we all are really, it's all of us together against the problem. And I did come to that with this sense of collaboration, that we all have to do this together across the west and really, frankly, across the world now to solve these problems. With that being said, I was really coming from a place of how do we ensure that somebody picking up these plans can definitively say that the utility has made this decision based off of, of an understanding of risk, and that they have made that most cost effective decision with that. The process that the recommendations that I made and some of which are being considered here today really is how do you mature this process and make it more standardized while still allowing for the individuation that's necessary for each utility, because each service territory is different. But how do you provide that information in a way that is transparent, understandable to members of the public, to staff, to anyone who picks that up, such that they can follow that sequence of the decision making framework in AHRQ and feel comfortable with the investments that are already being made. So with that, it is a process, like you said, there's going to be iterations in California. We're on our third one out here. But it's a constantly evolving process. There are going to be things that work, things that don't work",

        "text": " for helping us understand offline some of what's going on with PG's ratep proposal. It was very helpful to have staff as a resource to help us understand things that narrow the issues. We do, however, disagree with staff's recommendation the commission should approve pgs rates without correcting some of the issues we've highlighted in our comments that we're concerned with. And we recognize that the commission is investigating long term updates to purpa rate setting policies, and we did not initially plan to even file any comments on the specific rate update for that reason. However, after reviewing staff's report and more closely looking at PG's rate update, we were very concerned that the proposed rates are unjustifiably low and will deter development until new policies are adopted. Additionally, we felt that given the backdrop of uM, 2000, it's important to highlight the flaws that we see in this current system that are demonstrated with PG's current filing. As you know, the current rate calculation policy allows each individual utility to develop its own rate inputs in its IRP and oftentimes without all the QF stakeholders paying close attention to those data points that are developed. And then those are fed into the avoided cost rate calculation, which we have to try and review and identify reasons why we believe the rates are too low in a pretty expedited proceeding like this. But I will go through some of at a high level, the key problems that we were seeing in this particular proposal just at a high level. First, with the renewable rates, the non renewable rates excuse me the non renewable rates, the proposed value for this rate, which is just $46 per megawatt hour on a 15 year levelized basis for the baseload facility, and thus is kind of analogous to kind of the proxy that PG is calculating that appears to be significantly below the costs of actually developing operating a non renewable baseload resource in today's market. And we've pointed to comparable Oregon rates proposed by Idaho Power in Pacific or that are significantly higher, as well as comparable rates from the similar comparable proxy that's used in Oregon's neighboring state, Idaho. And these aren't small differences, these are major, significant 20% differences in some cases. So we understand that PGE's rate is likely the main driver of this difference is PG's gas forecast. I apologize if we misinterpreted staff's memo to suggest that the forecast itself is decreasing over time, but it is in fact decreasing as compared to PGE's existing forecast. And our understanding is it's substantially lower than what is being used by other utilities and is one of the major drivers here. But there could be other contributing factors also with the renewable rates. In our view, these are also unrealistically low. And as we highlighted in our comments, the 15 year levelized rate for what is basically, you know, the avoided renewable resource here, a wind, a gorge wind resource appears to be coming out at $30 per megawatt hour, which is probably due to the fact that the capacity factor for this resource was increased significantly in PGE's IRP, up to 44%. But there could be other factors. In any event, it's not in the ballpark of what we're seeing as the actual bid prices, average bid prices that were public made public from pgs immediately past RFP for renewable and solar resources, which, as we noted in our comments, were in the range of $60 per megawatt hour. So it seems to us something'clearly very out ofack with that rate and that drags all the renewable rates down. Despite the fact the solar renewable rates are going up. In our view, they they should probably be going up quite a bit more if they were to reflect what's actually possible to be built in the market. Finally, the solar plus storage rates. You know, the commission put this sol inter solar plus storage rate into effect last year to incent the addition of solar, excuse me, the addition of storage to solar QF and better meet the utilities's capacity needs. However, PGE's proposed rates, in our view, are not reasonable and won't result in use of this policy, the ELCC and PGE's proposal for solar plus storage decreases from 49% to 43%. And according to staff'calculations in its report, the four hour battery only adds 5% to the solar facilities ELCC and less than a dollar per megawatt hour on a 15 year levelized basis for the prices paid. So we don't see how this is really going to incent use of that policy. And I don't understand, I know there's a lot of moving parts here, but we just don't understand how the ELCC for solar could be going up and we support that. But solar plus storage is actually going down at the same time. And again, this is. I recognize the different utilities are different, but you know, another data point out there, both Idaho Power and",

        "text": " logic that staff have, which is if they were, if Pacifical was going to revise and resubmit their CEP before the next one is due in 2025, so we can move forward on this. We were going to need an acknowledged IRP and just, this is kind of the way that it was set up, and it's not a knock on Pacific core. I'm sure there are going to be a lot of discussions around what type of analysis needs to be in the IRP going forward around CEP. But for, for right now, without having to change their methodology, we didn't see a way around that. And it was a step we have acknowledged. I should have reviewed it. I was prompted by someone to look at that and I didn't. But wheat RDGe came back in to get acknowledged in the IRP update. I, I don't know if the commission, I don't believe the commission actually forced them to do, they might have been invited to do that, but we have acknowledged rather large items in an IRP update. And so my thought was if we wanted to move quickly on the CEP, we're going to need, at the bare minimum, a preferred portfolio and action plan that was the CEP could rest upon. Okay, thanks. Commissioner Tani, I leave it to you to ask any questions of staff before we get into stakeholder comments. I think youre double muted or something, or some such. Yeah, double muted from the break. The questions I had were along similar lines. I think the nuance I would add is, or sort of what I try to unpack a little further is we seem to have a very, we seem to have different perspectives on what the IRP update can be used for or should be used for right now, given that its coming in, in six or eight weeks. And so theres a host of recommendations that imply for their modeling. Are those by their nature then, given where the IRP update is at, those, are those functionally, from your perspective now, IR 2025 IRP action recommendations, or are you still hopeful that there's some, there some key pieces that you want to see in the IRP update as it approaches so quickly. Yeah. Than you, commission. Thanks, Commissioner Tany we felt like based on what was being represented to us by Pacific Ore, that, hey, we were going to be looking at elements of the preferred portfolio and the action plan and adjusting based on real time events. And they did lay out several things that they were going to do most on January 31. Looking at the coincident peak load, the gas and power market price updates, we didn't see what we were asking for as being that much of a stretch to have a preferred portfolio that reflected what they were actually planning to do. They talked about how would be the 2023 IRP would provide clear direction around the timeframe of resource acquisitions, where for the 2022 allso source RFP. So I, I don't think we were putting a lot on the IRP update insofar as we weren't asking for a tremendous amount more above and beyond what they're already doing. Just give us an acknowledgeable preferred portfolio and action plan. We did ask for two things. That one is to put in the 490 mw as a proxy resource in 2030 for the small scale renewables. We felt that was reflective of something they we were going to have to do, and that was a sizable amount of renewables. We could worry about cost allocations later. We did want them to fix, at the very minimum, the granularity adjustments. Again, I'm not the person having a jockey the model, but from what I understand and from the conversations, given what they were already planning to do around updating load and load forecast, we didn't see it as that big of a stretch to have this IRP, to have a CEP that was acknowledged. Right. So to have a CEP that was acknowledged sometime this summer so we can move on and begin assessing the next steps around the visibility into the future. And so we start talking about things around the public interest, right. And just get to the, that was the thought of staff and we didn't think was a stretch. Okay. Okay. So there'not from your perspective in the IRP essa, you were asking for tweaks around the edges as opposed to full scale. Thats what you mean when you say we werent ask for full new scenarios and model reruns. From that perspective, different cost inputs for coal and so on. You were trying to hone in on some things that were achievable in the construct of an IRP update from your perspective. And again, I don't want to labighor it, but the thought to us was if PAC was already going to be doing work to ensure the preferred portfolio action plan were responsive to changes. These are rather material changes. And we felt like if they were",

        "text": " you could, and right, this is all about batteries, right. You could have a 25 kilowatt, you know, you know, solar panel and a 25 kilowatt battery. And then when you add the two together, the nameplate rating, according to the definitions that, you know, we have consensus on for SGIP, would be 50 kw. But because the power control system limits export to 25 kw, then you have an export capacity of 25. So because that's the threshold that we have established for eligibility to use the simplified tier one screens. You know, from a system perspective. Sorry. From a technical perspective, it would be appropriate to use those simplified tier one screens, you know, for net metering projects up to that size limit as well. But I guess the, I mean, what you're describing as the nameplate capacity rating, which would be 50 for a battery and a solar, that's inconsistent with how FERC has decided to do it for purposes of purpa. Right. Which is a significant number of our jurisdictional interconnections. It's, it would be the nameplate capacity at the inverter. So you could have a, you know, if you had a 25 kilowatt solar facility and a 25 kiloww battery, you would, the nameplate capacity and you could export 25 at any one time. The nameplayate capacity is 25, not 50. I know, so I'm, but you're talk, so what you're talking about is that would be, that would be based on what the inverters are. But you're talking about another control other than the inverters, if I may add. So. Yeah, thanks. Yeah. So the, we have reached consensus in the s ##ape revision so far that, so if you look at the screens, the individual screens, there's like the penetration screens like 15% or the 100% minimum load screen. So that screen would use export capacity. But then when you go through those individual screens, there are screens that talk about protection. Those screens would still end up using n rating. So it would use the 50 that you're talking about. But the ones that are penetration related, we use the 25. So if you. I don't have it with me right now to share the screen. But they, the individual screens have been identified which ones would use export capacity and which ones will end up retaining or utilizing the nameplate rating. Okay. And again, within the net metering rules, I think the one place that it would be important to carry this concept over would be eligibility for tier one. Well the largest a facility can be would be 25 kw. That's a statut center. You could have a non residential facility. Exact. You can. I'm sorry. Yes, but the, the, the nameplay capacity is as it's stated here on this proposal, it's 25. You can't have a 50 kw solar facility. I mean you can if you measure it at the inverters, which is, I guess I thought how we're supposed to measure nameplayate capacity for a solar facility. I don't know, maybe the utilities. My, I'm probably misunderstanding something, but I guess I don't understand why we're talking about 50 megawatt facilities for 50 kiloww. Facilities for the 25 kiloww. Hey Stephanie, maybe I can jump in and Yoki or someone can correct to me. I think, I think what was being said was that, you know, the tier one screens for net metering applied to residential and non residential systems. And so if we didn't use export capacity like we'd been talking about and put in the division 82 then a non residential system that still has a nameplate capacity that qualifies for non residential net metering eligibility. I not eligible for tier one and I'I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing from a safety perspective, but I think folks were pretty comfortable with it u being eligible. Okay, thanks. Sorry about that. I think I could be wrong, but I think that's what it waseah okay. I think my questions answered. Thanks. Sorry to interrupt the conversation. No thanks, Stephanie. Clarification is always good. Any other thoughts on this section, this slide? If not, I'll move to the next one. Okay. Here you see some of the modifications we need to make to the division 82 rules to reflect what we're doing in division 39. So the first one is just a small proposed language. It's kind of in line with similar rules for division 29 related to qfs. And what else? Oh, one other thing that wasn't in the presentation that went out yesterday is the net metering facility needs to be added to the definition of applicant in division 82. Then we'll incorporate the two different division IEEE definitions in division 39. There any thoughts on",

        "text": "Good morning, everyone. Today's April 16, 2024, and we're here for a regular public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. All commissioners are present and we are backed by our new Oregon landscapes backgrounds here. So, for our regulars, welcome to the painted hills. And we'll start today, as we always do, with an opportunity for public comment on items not listed on the agenda for discussion. So, I don't know of anyone that has indicated they want to make public comment, but if you would like to, please just go ahead and unmute yourself, which you can do by pressing star six. If you are calling in, okay. Not hearing anyone that wishes to make general public comment'go, to the consent agenda first. So, commissioners, good morning, and let's move that direction. Good morning. This is Commissioner Tanei. I move we adopt the motions as outlined in each item on the consent agenda. Good morning. This is Commissioner Perkins. I second. I concur. The motion carries and the consent agenda is adopted. Thanks to staff and others for their work moving those items through today. We have two items for discussion. Our regular agenda includes regular agenda item number one, number 1728. Regular agenda item number two was removed and will be taken up at a later date. And then we have an item on our rulemaking agenda, which is at the stage in the rulemaking where it's commissioner deliberation only, the record is closed. So for that reason, I'm going to go ahead and take the regular agenda item first so that anyone that wishes to make public comment can leave, if they'd like, after we conclude that item. So for regular agenda item number one, which is PGE's docket number, um, 1028, they're avoided cost update. You know, I'm understanding that this is a relatively sort of procedural stage in the avoided cost update, but I'd love for Ryan Bean to come on up and introduce where, where we are with this and what we're deciding on today. Good morning, Ryan. Good morning, Chair Decker, Commissioner Tany and Commissioner Perkins, are you able to hear me okay? You sure are. All right. Excellent. For the record, my name is Ryan Bain. I am an analyst in the OPC. I'm joined today by staff manager Scott Givens and staff Coun Council Stephanie Andrews. On March 18, PGE file that's required post IRP avoided cost update. I'm here today to make recommendations on two procedural requests related to this filing. First, when the company filed its avoided cost rate updates, it requested a waiver of the commission's May 1 annual avoided cost update requirement. Due to the proximity to the avoided cost updates currently under review. Second, the Oregon solar plus Storage Industries association filed a request to waive the 30 day effective date for post IRP avoided cost updates to provide more time for review. ##a requested that PGE's post IRP avoid cost update come before the commission at the May 28 public meeting. Staffap support O'Request for more time because it will allow a review of the supplemental filing made by the company last week. Staff recommends that the commission balance the need for additional review with the need for staff and parties to focus on modernizing the avoided cost methods in docket number uM 2000, which will continue to ramp up throughout May, and therefore, staff recommends that the commission take up the company's avoided cost rate updates at the May 14 public meeting. As described in our memo, staff does not believe a waiver is required to move the effective date of PGE's filing and instead believes the commission can issue an order suspending the post IRP avoid cost filing for further investigation. Therefore, staff recommends that the commission suspend the avoided cost filing until May 15 with respect to PGE'request to waive the requirement to file an avoid a cost update on May 1. Staff believes good cost supports this waiver because, given the staff and stakeholder requested delay of the review of PGE's post IRP filing, an update filed on May 1 would be duplicative and unnecessary. So, in summary, staff recommends that the commission wait the May 1 filing and delay the effective date for the post IRP avoid cost filing, suspending the current filing until May 15. With that, I'm available to answer any questions. Thank you, Ryan. I appreciate staff laying this out clearly and presenting well, I guess what I view as a reasonable process going forward, but I'll stop and ask if commissioners have any questions for staff. Okay, thanks for that summary. And again, thanks for laying it out so clearly that so people can respond to is there any public comment? Please raise your hand if you'd like to comment on this item. If you have any trouble finding the raise your hand button, you can just unmute yourself. But it looks like either or both of Marie",

        "text": " the key revisions for modernizing the screens. To really account for not only batteries, which is what the toolkit was focused on, but differences between inverter based ders and rotating machines. And Ted here, I just want to say that listening to Mike, it's, you know, part of this whole investigation is to bring transparency and that for the developers and whatnot. So if it's confusing for the developers, hopefully we can find some way to make it less confusing. Keep that in mind. Thank you. That's really my concern. I've worked in the utility industry for 50 years. I totally appreciate the concerns about the damage that over voltage can cause. It's just I'm trying to make sure that whatever process we use, it makes it straightforward and simple for people to apply the screen. Especially to an inverter based generation source. So I don't. I guess so. In response to Mike and Ted, I think, you know, certainly would be open to considering ways to make this less confusing. I. I mean I'm a lawyer so I don't have to understand this stuff, but I don't fully understand it. And I think in response to IR rec you know, it's helpful to hear that this is, sounds like this an important issue for you all and one that you've worked on a lot. And I think we can, you know, take it back and take another look at if there's something that we could change that would help us be more comfortable with it. I'm, I'm not making any promises because I'm hearing via chat that there's just really a lot of concern about that third row. But you know, we reviewed midhots's message and we'll take that back. And, and like I said we can take another, another look. And I don't know if there's any engineers from the utilities that want to have any questions or want to say anything else about that. Another thing to potentially investigate is, you know, we've looked previously, but I think we've looked previously at the grounding screen developed also in batteries for supplemental review which includes a review of the loading on the circuit. The line to neutral connectedose that for supplemental review because we figured that would be a slightly more detailed there would have to do. But if there's an opportunity to bring that into initial review that could potentially resolve the issue with the screen and, and maybe the 80% trans, it's rounding screen in supplemental RO and there's a few options there to determine if something is effectively grounded. And you know, either that your screen could be brought in or the, at least for inverters one of that could be assessed in initial review. Sorry. I know Brian was cutting out a little bit. Let me summarize to make sure that everyone understood what he was saying. He's saying that we also had a supplemental grounding screen that we proposed for supplemental review and if the utilities are more comfortable with that screen that's in supplemental review and are willing to take the time to. You know, we generally propose that for supplemental review because we think it's a little more time intensive. But if the utilities are willing to take that time and do that analysis in the fast track process, we would be open to bringing that in here if that's their preference. And then the other thing I would d add is I would encourage the utilities to, you know, I believe all of the utilities are members of EPRI and EPI has done a lot of work on this screen. So I would encourage the utilities to talk to, you know, their colleagues about EPI, about why they designed this screen, because we worked with them, but they did the heavy lifting. Great, thanks. So the last two screens that I listed here, the network screen for tier two and the inadvertent export screen, I think that the joint utilities. Oh yeah. If there's any. Every resources or specific people we should talk to, could you let us know just to make that, help us make that connection more easily and put it in the chat on the network screen and inadvertent export screen. The joint utilities have not landed on a final position and are still evaluating and discussing internally and amongst themselves. I do think, I do know that at least for the inadvertent export screen, we just wanted to ask to better understand where that equation came from and sort what was behind it. And if there's any additional detail that you all want to provide us on the tier two network screen, that would, that might also be helpful. And. Thanks. I see we're getting a lot of resources in the t for that bre. Thank you. Yeah. Before I turn this over to the engineers, I'll just start out by saying that both the inadvertent export screen and the line configuration screen were both a part of the energy storage interconnection toolkit. I put the link in the chat, I filed it in the docket in March, I believe, the day after we published it with Epi. And that is one of the national standards that I've been referring",

        "text": " Good morning Madison. Welcome. Thanks for introducing this item. Thank you and good morning chair Decker, commissioners Ti and Thompson. For the record, my name is Madison Bolton. I'm an energy and policy analyst in the strategy and integration division at the PUC. I'm joined today by staffsel Johanna Rieman Schneider. I'm here today to recommend approval of Pacific Corp's request for a waiver of the competitive bidding rules, or CBR'for, the pair of solar resources Horn shadow. Horn shadow one and two, totaling 300 nameplate capacity. For some background on this, Vatess, a subsidiary of meta Platforms, executed an agreement to purchase the renewable energy certificates generated by the Horn Shadow Resources under Pacific Corp. Schedule 272 tariff in order to serve its prospective load for an Oregon data center. Schedule 272 is Pacific Corps'voluntary renewable energy rider bulk purchase option. Pacific Corp. Filed for waiver of the competitive bidding rules on May 18. It also provided a notice of contract execution on May 25 as required in docket number uM 2000. 163. The competitive bidding rules require resources to be vetted in a request for proposals process or an RFP, but they can also be waived for good cause shown and do not imply in certain circumstances pursuant to Oregon administrative rule chapter 860, division 89, section 100, and Pacific Corp. Is requesting the waiver pursuant to the subsection three B of that rule, which states that there's a time limited opportunity to acquire a resource that offers unique value to the utilities customers. So staff reviewed Pacific Corpps analysis of the sale price per rec delivered energy price and the resources system value. Staff also reviewed that the allocation of costs and benefits hold holds other customers harmless and staff does agree that this agreement provides value to Oregon customers consistent with the CBR requirement. The time limited portion of Pacific Corp's argument for the waiver was also highlighted in the filing. The developer of the resource, de Sha Energy, or Desri, has time constraints related to its large generator interconnection agreements, real estate agreements, and conditional use permits for the resources. And all of these issues have required that the timing of this filing and commission approval land outside of Pacific Corps RFP in order to achieve that required commercial operation date for the schedule 272 agreement. Pacificorp held workshops for interested parties on June 8 and discussed the agreement and the resource staff and Citizens Utility Board Cub attended the workshops. Cub did not express concern with this procurement, which has remained true throughout this process to the best of staff's knowledge, and I do want to discuss some more big picture concerns that staff raised in the memo. First, I'll just briefly say that staff encourages future voluntary procurements to identify resources with high system value, so things like direct emission reduction capabilities or more flexible capacity or products with 24/7 matching. But the other major issue here is the emerging considerations related to House Bill 2021 implementation. So as part of docket uM 2273 and the House Bill 2020 2021 implementation investigation, the commission is examining how RECs should be treated for compliance with emission targets. The issue here is we just don't know what policy will be in place or what the results of that investigation will be at this point. But there's some safeguards we can consider right now that could mitigate risk down the road. So, for example, in this case, if new legislation or a commission determination ends up requiring that a resource cannot be considered non emitting for Oregon compliance purposes, specifically, if that wreck of the resources retired for an individual customer, the Horn shadow negotiated agreement and other existing voluntary product agreements would become problematic, Oregon customers would effectively be locked into agreements for a resource that couldn't be classified as non emitting under the purview of HB 2021. And that's an issue where mitigating risk now could help prevent harm in the future when we have less ability to get ahead of that problem. That's not to say we won't be able to have discussions in the future about actions like a carve out for voluntary products that could allow them to be considered, not omitting or something to that effect, but staff is just recommending here that since we don't know the outcomes related to rec valuation yet and some possible mitigation strategies, and I have a couple of options that staff has recommended in the memo. Staff's preferred approach is to require that Pacificorp and vatesss ensure these wrs are retired in such a way where Oregon's allocation of the generation can always be reported as non oitting, and the way this could function is a requirement to revisit the schedule 272 agreement to make an amendment should that issue arise, and that would leave the door open for parties to come back together discuss the appropriate way to mitigate the impacts of some kind of rec related policy change. A less favorable option outlined in the memo would be suspending PACX voluntary renewable programs in Schedule 272 and SU hundred 73. While the commission",

        "text": " PUC in the country. So our goal is to provide you a bit of information on how to identify issues that you care about and when, when we're going to engage with those in a specific case and how to track those issues as we go forward. So once again, just a final reminder before we get started, I really encourage questions. We're going to use the raise your hand feature in Zoom. You should be familiar with that if you're not just to mute yourself and ask your question. And then if you're on the phone, you can press star six to unmute. All right, so let's begin. We're going to start with general background on the form and function of our commission. So who is the commission? The commission is three people who are experts in their field, and they're delegated specific responsibilities from the legislature. We'll talk about the fact that a little later that the amount of responsibility that has been delegated to the commission has really increased over the years. Us states have regulatory bodies to protect customers and ensure rational utility development. This is common to every state in the nation has a utility commission. And our specific mission is to ensure Oregonians have access to safe, reliable, and fairly priced utility services that advance state policy and promote the public interest. Interest. And it's important that we use an inclusive process to evaluate differing viewpoints and visions of the public interest and arrived at a balanced, well reasoned, independent decision supported by fact and law. Just for those of you that have participated with us for a while, our mission has changed slightly recently to really recognize the fact that we're more and more responsible for implementing state policy, much more so than we used to be. Then also we have expanded our explanation of how we engage with stakeholders in our mission. We think that's reflective of some of the changes we've made here at the commission recently. All right, so let's talk broadly about why the commission is important. Utilities aren't like other businesses. So specifically, utility service is essential. It's very important for your everyday life, and it's tied to major infrastructure. It's not something that is easily replicated. So customers generally can't look for alternatives. We don't want, for example, transmission lines to be built willy nilly all over the country in the service of allowing anyone to provide utility service. We want that major development to happen rationally and to ensure that we're efficiently utilizing and developing major infrastructure. If you want to get a picture of why we have regulated utilities, you can look back at old photos of New York City back at the turn of the century, prior regulation. What you had was a jumble of wires running across the city because anyone could provide utility service, and that service was completely unregulated. You had actually quite unsafe situation with a lot of duplicated infrastructure. And the other thing you had is you had a situation where in rural areas, service was not provided at all because those customers weren't seen as desirable, they weren't seen as profitable. So utilities had no reason to bring service to those communities. So these are the kind of the core reasons why utilities are rate regulated and regulated heavily by the commission. When I say rate regulated, what I mean is that utilities can only charge rates or at least utilities we fully regulate as determined by us, that are lawful, just unasonable after a proceeding in which stakeholders and citizens may participate in. The idea is that it's transparent. We have an opportunity to review a particular charge before it's put in place and the public has the opportunity to weigh in and communicate to the commission. As I mentioned earlier, the legislature has also provided a lot of other responsibilities to the commission because utilities are so important in terms of environment and social impact. The PUC has been designated as a body by the legislature to work through a lot of complicated policy objectives. We get a lot of work from the legislature. The legislature has confidence in the commission, and I think that confidence comes from how our stakeholders engage with us. And legislature knows that everyone will have an opportunity to impact a particular policy that we might put in place because of all that. Process is really important here. We're trying to listen to stakeholders, we need to listen to stakeholders. We need to balance things, and that means we need to have clear process and accessible process. After all is said and done, the commission makes a decision and that decision will have a real impact on the ground conditions. Utility service in general. So projects are going to happen or they're not going to happen. Money gets invested in one solution versus another, rates go up or they change or they don't go up as much as a utility wanted. All of that is real change that happens on the ground. So let's talk about our responsibilities delegated by the legislature. We are asked by the legislature to protect consumers and balance the interest of utilities. You might ask, why? Why shouldn't it be all consumer focused? Well, the idea is that in order for a utility to function effectively,",

        "text": " would involve deleting the sentence that allows the relay time to be less than 2 seconds on high speed reclosing circuits. In our conversations with lots of utilities and the Electric Power Research Institute over the three year period that led to the development of the Department of Energy funded batteries project, we didn't hear these concerns from any other utilities on the use of relays, and we have not seen any other states that have adopted export control rules use this language. That's what I'll say from a process development perspective. And then if I could turn it over to mhat mafazi to speak a little bit more to the engineering side of things. Thank youit mafazi again with ir am. Yeah, so just to highlight one aspect of the batteries toolkit, which involved working with utilities and EPI, there was an extensive modeling that was part that, that was required as part of creating this RUL language. And April is the one that carried out a lot of the simulations, especially the ones that involved even the power control systems and export controls and different scenarios were modeled in terms of thresholds and when it will be an issue for the export controls or inarian export. And just again, to highlight what Yoki said, not once did any of the, every personnel or any of the group members picked up issues with relays. There were some concerns regarding how fast we want to require the power control systems, which is longer than even the 2 seconds. So when you talk about the power control system, it's, the certification is it can be less than 30 seconds and that's a pass. So the relays, which is 2 seconds and that's very fast compared to the power control systems. And yeah, we didn't see any issues on those aspects, nor did April. And then the last thing I'll say to conclude our comments on the subject. Hang on 1 second. Mister Zakai, Commissioner Tony, did you have a question? Thanks Joelwine. I appreciate you discussing the research that youve done. My limited understanding of our use of these high speed reclouress in the northwest is in part a wildfire mitigation risk reduction exercise tool. And ye, that's my, when I read reclosuress, I read them in that context of the way they are being used to manage incidental contacts during high, as opposed to having to shit a whole circuit off. And I'm curious, maybe I'm misunderstanding how they're being used. If I am, someone should further educate me. But in any of your work around whether 2 seconds was enough or not enough, did the fhir application come into play? The Firehi mitigation application come up? Yeah, we didn't look at specifically at fire mitigation issue, but the timing was definitely at play to see. So it's not a question about whether the recloauser should or shouldn't trip at that timing. It's a matter of you are requiring the relay to do the same thing as what the invata is already doing. They will trip within 2 seconds. So that's where the concern is. So Invara is already capable of doing this and now you're setting that, it's requiring the specific piece of equipment as opposed to relying on the. Yeah, so the added sentence basically requires the relay to trip faster than 2 seconds and already the inverter can do that functionality. I see. Okay, I'm caught up on the issue, I apologize. I mean, what do you think is going on here? I mean, we're faced in this rulemaking with our staff and utility position that says the inverter can't do it or has historically not been reliable enough to do it, or maybe isn't always programmed to do it. I don't know. And you're saying Godd issue didn't come up in an entire national discussion of this issue? What do you attribute, or am I. I mean, I'm just highly confused by this. Yeah, maybe there is. It's worth investigating. Maybe there is that portion. But what the utilities. What the language is pausing there to do. And I believe no other state has that state requirement. So already we're introducing these new capabilities with export controls, but all the other states that have adapted this particular language do not have these additional requirement. Okay, well, thank you for that clarification, Chair Decker. Do you have any other questions? Just wondering if yoci's got any explanation of the distinction, you know, why no other state has this requirement? Any policy level explanation you can give me? Not that I am aware of. I mean, really, a lot of these discussions typically involve establishing a track record of performance of inverters so that utilities can trust them to respond in the way that they are designed to do so. And in my experience, you know, even if a inverter meets its certification requirement, utilities are sometimes hesitant to trust that it will perform in the way that meets its certification requirement, because inverters, compared to other types of technologies used on the electrical system,",

        "text": " about as we consider revisions. Thank you. Than. Great. Okay. I think we've got a lot of the issues that are on our minds out there. So I guess take this moment to open up any public comment that we might have on this. So please raise your hand. And that's using star nine if you're on the phone. All right, let's hear from Jack Watson Foria. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Chair Decker, Commissioners Tanei, and Thompson. For the record, my name is Jack Watson. I'm the director of policy and regulatory affairs for the Oregon Solar and Storage Industries association. First, OA would like to thank staff for their involvement in the docket. Additionally, OSEA is appreciative of Pacific course thought thorough engagement throughout the DSP process. Oo participated extensively in the DSP workshops and recommended a non wire solution for the Klamath Falls area. For Pacific course DSP, we are extremely supportive of the community engagement. The utility used to solicit feedback on the non wire solutions and through that process, developing an additional non wire solution, and would recommend that the utility continue to pursue this type of direct community engagement and future iterations of the DSP. Additionally, ASA would urge the utility to incorporate lessons learned from the DSP part two in the next DSP, for example, the selection of transitional study areas for potential non wire solutions. We believe it would be beneficial to see a more urban portion of PAC service territory examined in futuresp processes. Additionally, we are extremely supportive of the utilities decision to acquire SCADA data for each of their substations. We believe this data will be very important moving forward into next iterations of the DSP. Thank you for the opportunity to comment today, and I'll be available for any questions. Thanks, Jack, for your comments and for OA's engagement here. Think one of the things that seems like a bright spot with this particular DSP effort is, I don't know, that the community engagement felt really practical. You had the development community, you had local government. Maybe you also had some community folks, and maybe it wasn't broad scale, system wide, but it seemed like a good model for finding like a real thing. And the development commun community'engagement is certainly a big part of that. So thanks. Any other questions or comments for Jack? Thanks. Let's go to Fred Hewitt with Northwest Energy Coalition. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Chair Decker and commissioners Tony and Thompson. Fred Huwitt, on behalf of Northwest Energy Coalition. My colleague Jeff Bestssnet is here also. I don't know if he will have anything to add very quickly because we put in our comments and that provides a fair bit of detail of our view. The first thing to say is, I think that each utility has provided a quite somewhat different path in terms of responding to the DSP requirements. We're learning a lot from all of them. And first, I wanna commend the commission staff and the commission for setting this process up in a way that provided a lot of openness to that and is also providing a very clear set of guidance about what qualifies for acceptance of these plans. And the second thing is to say, I think all three companies have done a good job in getting started. We're learning a great deal from this, and that was part of our hope for this process from the very beginning. And now we're moving more to a phase of you. What are we going to do with learning that we're now getting, and again, each one of the companies, including PAC Civic Corps, is offered, you know, I think, a custom solution basically for their system, for the starting point. And we think there's some real value to that and they're taking it seriously. The issues that we focused on in our comments on the PAC DSP primarily focused on the community engagement part of it. And I think, if anything, I would summarize that simply by saying our priority is to make sure to encourage Pacific or to continue to target and prioritize historically underinvested communities and those that are disproportionately affected by the current energy situation that we're in. And we have provided some additional details on that. And finally, just to say, to put on the record, we do support the staff report and their recommendation. Thank you. Thank you, Fred, and thanks for the thoughtful comments and for your cheerleading of positive progress on this effort throughout the timeline. We really need to, need to know that people care and people can engage, because, of course, this is important, but big effort, and it means a lot to have you folks at the table. Anything else for Fred O? I think that for this stcket, we're at the point of taking action, which I forgot to do this morning, so let's not repeat that. But I'm very much open to any discussion or deliberation before we take action as well. Nothing really for me to add. I'll just say, you know, the staff memo is really thorough, and the",

        "text": "2023 IRP. The generation profile reflects a solar plus storage resource that charges exclusively from the onite solar resource and prioritizes discharged daily during the four hour period for each month with the highest loss of load probability. And so these are the steps we did to develop the price. So, identify the highest loss of load probability hours in our sequoia model, we produce a solar and storage generation profile in the storage dispatch model that aligns with the highest loss of load probability hours. We model the solar and storage ELCC and Sequoia using a generation profile that reflects peak hour assignment. We then calculate a premium capacity payment with solar and storage ELCC and peak capacity factor, so that ended up being 53 22. Then we replaced the 16 hours on peak avoided cost with the premium peak hour capacity payment, and that equals our solar plus storage avoided cost price. And then for the capacity contribution calculation, we produced the loss of load heat map for 2026 test year using PGE'sequoia model, the most recently updated in the 2023 IRP addendum. And then we used the UM 2011 best practices to tune the portfolio. And within the Excel model, we modeled the generation profile of the solar hybrid resource with peak hour assignment that corresponds to the highest loss of load probability hours. And then we modeled the ELCC of the resulting solar generation profile within sequoia. Because the utility can't dispatch the battery, the resource was modeled as a solar resource with a unique generation profile. And so the result, the result is a 49% capacity contribution. So next we did thisare. We looked at the Aurora and our power decks, heat maps, and these show that in the winter, in the morning, there is a need, there is a, there is a need for energy, that power can be more valuable. So this was what we proposed in our filing for our proposed premium peak hours. So 4 hours select ReFCt selected reflect the system need via both sequoia and the power prices. And so we're proposing November through February, a morning dispatch of five, five to 07:00 a.m. and then in the evening, seven to 09:00 p.m. and then in the months March through October, just an evening dispatch of six to 10:00 p.m. and we did a comparison and we did an analysis and having the morning, a morning morning premium peak hour only resulted in a reduction in the compensation to the QF of 0.02%. And Chris, what was that alternative as opposed to. As opposed to just doing like a six to ten dispatch twelve months out of the year. So the morning hours in this determination where you're relying on market prices, is this right? Well, we talked to our power operations. We talked to our power operations folks and, and looking at these heat maps where we were relying on, on that. Really. Chris, what I like to dig into a bit is in your'filing you mentioned that the peak hours might, may be taking advantage of additionally this expected power cost benefit to customers. So I was just hoping you could give us a little more elaboration here. Tess or Jimmy, do you want to chime in on that? Yeah, I can take crack at that. Can folks all hear me on my audio connection? Yep. Okay, awesome. So yeah, the, as Chris is presenting here, we are proposed the following premium peak hours that we note in the filing are, you know, different than the hours of the highest loss of load expectation from the reliability model. And we think it's appropriate to have that be different because we believe that this dispatch profile will be generating greater wholesale benefit for our customers. And we come to that conclusion in direct conversations with our power ops team and asking them, hey, if we had a solar storage project, what hours, what profile would appear to bring the best value to the system? Recognizing that sort of routine daily solar plus storage operation is a little bit different than peak reliability. Emergency planning conditions and power operations indicated that they thought the most value be delivered if the winter months were divided between a morning and evening period of time. As you sort of see the proposed hours in this slide, that's different than the loss of load probability findings from slide five. And, but we continue to believe that, as mentioned, that more sort of neverable power costs type values delivered to customers through the premium peak hours proposed. And you see like evidence of that looking at the power prices in slide six. So while our proposal isn't directly mapping these four, the highest 4 hours in either a power DecX backward looking analysis or Aurora forecast forward looking analysis, we're not directly mapping to the boxed hours here, but we do provide this information to indicate to reinforce sor of our power Ops team's opinion that there can be more valuable for customers",

        "text": "Good afternoon. Today is January 31, 2023 and we're here for a special public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. And we're here today for PGE to give a presentation on a year in review for the company. PGE has an annual tradition of providing an overall business update to the commission in the early part of the year. As we get started and get ready to hand it over to the company to make that presentation. I wanted to note that we, of course, have many stakeholders who are new to the PUC who may not be familiar either with this tradition or the reason why we would take the time for a more comprehensive update from one of our regulated utilities. PGE, of course, is like many non utility stakeholders in that the company is engaged in many dockets with contested issues before the PUC. It's also unlike our non utility stakeholders in that through rate cases we are comprehensively regulating the economics of the business overall. And it's really important that we have a broader context for understanding what the company is experiencing beyond the narrow and prescribed lens of the rate case which we anticipate PGE to file here in the next month or so. I still want to point out that today is an opportunity for information to be provided to the company and not, it goes without saying, advocacy on particular dockets or issues that are in contention at the commission. That's all the opening that I have other than to welcome the PGE team for this presentation. But I want to ask my colleagues whether they have any other opening comments they'd like to make before we hand it over, I think. For me. Thanks. I think that was a great introduction. Good to see you all and look forward to the update. Absolutely. I think you covered the waterfront and looking forward to hearing from the company on the landscapes they're operating in. Great. And I think it goes without saying, based on my introduction but this is an invited, testimony only presentation and obviously, plenty of opportunities for public comment on those issues that are before the commission in other dockets. But I'll leave it there and welcome Maria Pope, CEO of PGE. President of PGE to kick us off. Great. Thank you very much, chair Decker. And thank you, commissioners Tawi and Thompson. It's an honor to be in front of you today. I'm joined by Larry Beckeadal, Brett Sims and Kristen Sheeran. And we're very pleased to be able to share with you the state of the utility. First and foremost, customers are at the center of what we do. We reflect our customers and this region's values. And we support the focus on clean, sustainable energy future. Over the last number of years, we have doubled down on technology investments, improving every aspect of our customer service, and driving operational efficiencies across our company. We take a partnership approach to our work as we recognize that the diverse skills and capabilities that are needed for a clean energy transformation will be tremendous and we never lose focus that safe, reliable and affordable electricity is foundational and core to our company's purpose. As we reemerge from COVID this past year, it was hard, is hard for customers, for the economy and for employees. I could not be more proud of the incredible amount of work that we have done for customers in 2022, as well as meeting the challenges of a changing climate and addressing complex and ever more volatile power markets. If we could turn to the next slide. Our overall strategy, and you've probably seen this page many times before, is combined of three main parts, to decarbonize, to electrify, and most importantly, to perform. We set our strategy almost five years ago, and I'm even more convinced today that it's the right direction. The only exception is that the pace of change has been, is, and will probably continue to be much more significant than we ever anticipated. On the decarbonization side, Kristen Sheeran will talk about our path to 80% carbon reductions by 2030 and our longer term goal of 100% clean energy by 2040. When we first set this goal, we look to the science and work to align our goals with the United nations fifth IPCC climate report, 80% reductions by 2050, which we then thought was very aggressive. And just a few years later, with the 6th IPCC climate Report, we evaluated and adjusted, moving our goals forward. And while we are making much progress, we know we have a lot of work to do, and Kristen will touch on that in a second. On the electrify front with customers, the center of all we do, we appreciate that electricity is the cleanest form of energy and we needed to relook at our system and how we operate the electric grid. Today, we are dramatically smarter and more interconnected. Larry will discuss our virtual power plant strategy and investments in maintaining a safe, reliable system in",

        "text": " the off chance that what is the probability that's going to be called upon over a 15 year contract term? I have no idea. So it's an interesting possibility here, but I don't know quite where it goes for QF pricing. Well, thank you. Thank you for that comment. And then see Caroline more. Yeah, it's similar to Dan. It's a question, though, for the folks on the line. I'm just curious if anyone on the line has knowledge of whether these types of configurations typically come in through purpa just to set staff on. Give us an advance, give us a head start in considering your proposal. We can do some research, because I agree with you, Greg, that this is something that's valuable for the commission to consider in some form or another. Well, I'm not aware of any that have come in through Purpa yet, and I think one of the reasons for that is because you'd have to negotiate a one off agreement with someone with the perspective of Dan McNe and what he just expressed, that he doesn't think it's a good idea. So I'm aware that some folks have tried and didn't get real far or it was difficult and didn't have the bandwidth to get through that process. So we think it's worth at least looking at. There may be impediments that make it not worth it, but clearly there is direction in the legislation to try and encourage this and in the Odo report that came out of the legislation. Okay. Yeah, thanks. If there are folks who have any info that they could point staff to about projects, micrograde projects that have operated through Purpa or anything like that, that would be super appreciated. And maybe that's what you're going to say, Marie. Yeah, I think the. I guess I'll just provide n Sun's perspective on it. Like we. So nun had worked on the development of some projects out in Harney county that executed Purpa contracts. And for those who don't know as much about the grid out in Harney county, it's at the very end of the. The BPA Harney line, and that line has, on occasion, gone down. And so the local community in that area has not had. Had power or. Or whatnot, you know, so. But then they see these solar like, generating facilities right next to their house, and they're sort of like, is there a way that we can capitalize on the fact that this project is located right next to us and that project is not able to deliver their output because they're also delivering over that same line to Portland general. But. But they, you know, could serve that local area in that, you know, emergency kind of situation where, you know, there was like a forest fire or something and the line was down. And so that, that's kind of the situation that we've been contemplating. U I don't, you know, I don't know technically how all of that would happen and if, you know, if it would be considered a microgrid or like, what you would even call it, but just like, you know, being able to generate to perhaps, like the Harney Electric co op or, you know, whatever in that kind of situation and just be able to provide those resiliency benefits from a project that is, you know, QF. And, Zach, you got your hands. Hey, thanks. Yeah, thanks. Ryan. Zachrigal Pac here. I've been trying to find the resiliency report from, um, 22 25, and I think I just found it. I'll drop that in the chat, but at least from my perspective, that's the best kind of state utility commission survey of relevant utility commission resiliency practices. I have't seen anything that's ventured down creating a resiliency value for purpa, avoided cost practices, either for standard or non standard qfs. And I just note from, um, 2225, the commission issued guidance directing utilities to incorporate resiliency analyses more robustly in our upcoming ceps. And so to the extent we have that information in our next ceps, maybe it feels like that's a more appropriate time to then figure out what to do with some sort of QF resiliency adder after we've done initial analyses on the whole system. But yeah, once I find that, I think it's GMLC. Once I find that report, il ll drop it in the chat. Thank you so much for everyone's comments on this. No doubt we'll have a bit more discussion, and I appreciate the resources that they are being shared in chat. With that, I think we'll get into step Step's proposal and we can discuss parties comments now in the aim of improving staff proposal ahead of the phasei contested case, and starting here with the price streams proposal to eliminate the renewable rate and non renewable rate distinction, I'm wondering if there's a way for the parties opposed if there's a way for SAS proposal to be amended",

        "text": "? Not that I am aware of. I mean, really, a lot of these discussions typically involve establishing a track record of performance of inverters so that utilities can trust them to respond in the way that they are designed to do so. And in my experience, you know, even if a inverter meets its certification requirement, utilities are sometimes hesitant to trust that it will perform in the way that meets its certification requirement, because inverters, compared to other types of technologies used on the electrical system, are relatively new. So typically it comes down to trusting the inverters to perform according to their design. I have another question. I guess I want to. Well, anyway, I can leave it alone. I'll just say, since we're having a rulemaking hearing and this is on my mind, I'll just throw it out there. I understand that inverter technology is advancing and that there are those within the reliability space, at least those that speak to the Kreci Wirera, meaning that are indicating that as penetration of distributed resources increases, we have to go from grid following inverters of today to better program grid following inverters, and eventually up to the stage of grid forming inverters. And it's both the reliability dynamic that is before us here today. Also my sense that this does have to remain a dynamic space that's making me so worried about this issue and worried about why we're leaving it here. And it goes not only to do we need to be as conservative as some folks are advocating here today, is the flexibility in the rules enough, but also how do we keep these rules fresh enough that the solar industry can step up to more rigorous requirements as penetration increases, and we need those more advanced inverter capabilities? It feels late in the process to be introducing this, but it also feels like something that I'm worried about having to come back to. So I would encourage us, if anyone has any further comments for me, both on the dispute that we're having here, but also on how best can things be kept. Can we keep advancing from a process perspective if I haven't said that enough, that's what I'm interested in hearing more about. Eoki or free to respond. And then I guess we'll go back to staff. Thank you. I would just close my comments on this topic by saying that we will provide the batteries toolkit into the record for this rulemaking, as well as Irex most recent version of our model interconnection rules so that you can have those available for your consideration. So, thank you. Thanks. Heidi Caswell of staff. Did you want to make a comment here? I was just going to offer a couple of things that we spoke about, and that really was recognizing that we're in a time of a lot of changes. And those changes have to do with practices in light of things like wildfire mitigation, other kind of resilience activities, and a lot of change that's happening with the infrastructure of the utilities. But also recognizing that in the, as lessons are learned about kind of the handshakes that exist between new equipment on the network, like an inverter, and the legacy equipment, we then learn something from that and that can inform the future. And I think that that trust that yogi is speaking about is really about understanding where you reach tipping points that cause problems, you investigate those problems, you learn from it, you retool. And so the hope that I think we had was as the technology matures and the evidence is there that certain types of controls are no longer required, then there would be flexibility to really loosen some of that. But until that certainty of the operational performance exists, that it feels like that is the right kind of midpoint, I guess, to allow the addition of those resources. Thank you. Yeah. Would you say that every utility has to individually reach that level of confidence, or can we rely on lessons learned from more advanced grids? I guess I would welcome the utilities to speak up on it, but I think there's a lot of socialization of that learning that's happening, whether it's through NRC or the IEEE committees that are focused on smart grid and advancing those kinds of uses of the network, as well as then some of the industry forums that exist more regionally based. So it feels to me like not everybody has to learn it individually without, in order for it to be kind of integrated into their practices. All right, thank you, Heidi. Anybody else have any comments they'd like to offer at this time on the technical items? The first group of issues that we have here. Yes, Jack Watson of OA. Yeah, I just had two pieces. First on the advanced inverter equipment. I think the requirement date that ire put forward is acceptable. The only concern that I have would be whether energy trust and the utilities are able to update their power clerk systems in order to accommodate the new IEEE standards into the application process between now and January. And then the second thing on the thresholds for net metering",

        "text": "Good afternoon, everyone. It's January 10, 2023, and you're here for a special public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. Today we're gathered in docket number, uM, 2000 143, which is the Oregon PUC's resource adequacy investigation. But we're not here to make any decisions in that docket. We're really here for a technical conference to hear both from our staff about what's going on in that investigation, but also from some valued experts on resource adequacy from around the western. I think I can speak for all of us when I say that we're really excited and to have this forum for just learning and engagement about this most important of topics, really. And we're extremely grateful to our participants for making the time for a special purpose audience with us here. I know we have an agenda posted in the docket and on our public meeting webpage, but I thought I would just take a minute to go through the agenda and address how we're going to handle stakeholder comment, because I do see quite a few folks other than our presenters on the meeting. And I do know that some of you have emailed Christy in advance expressing a desire to comment during the final section or the nearly final section of our meeting. So first we're going to hear from WEC. Next we're going to hear from the Northwest Power and Conservation Council. They're both going to be talking with us about the work that they've been doing in resource adequacy. Then we're going to get an update from the Western Power polol on the development of the Western Resource adequacy program, which currently is before FERC. Then, as I said, we're going to get an update on the state specific investigation that POUC staff has been working on for some time. Then we'll have an opportunity for stakeholder comments about the topic of resource adequacy. Broadly, we're going to have to keep that relatively limited and won't have a ton of time for back and forth dialogue. But we really are interested in what others in the region think we should be focused on in the area of resource adequacy. The agenda says that we'll have commissioner questions at the end, but we are not known for saving our questions until the end. So our presenters should expect some questions if we have them throughout. But commissioners, we will, I think, try to stick to the timelines that are set forth in the agenda so that we can get to hearing from stakeholders that aren't the invited presenters here. Toward the end. So, commissioners, is there anything that you want to say by way of introduction or by way of logistics that I might not have covered? You've covered it all from perspective. Thanks. Great. Okay. Well, anything that staff wants to say by way of introduction, it's fine. Fine. If not, not on the agenda. All right, then I think we're going to just launch right into our first presentation. And Christy, you can go ahead and call up the slides from the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, or WEC. And good afternoon, Victoria. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for inviting me to speak today. As the slides come up, I'll introduce myself. I'm Victoria Ravenscroft. I'm the senior policy and external affairs manager for WEC, and I work very closely with our resource adequacy team on shaping the analyses and also sharing that information with folks. Today I'm going to talk a little bit about Wex s perspective of resource adequacy. We do have a fairly unique perspective. It's an interconnection wide perspective, so I'll be talking about that a little bit today. Okay, thank you. If you'go to the next slide, I do want to take just 1 minute to explain who WEC is and what we do in the interconnection. For those who may not be aware of that, WEC is the regional entity for the western interconnection, and that is a designated title and a delegated function that we receive. And we are given authority and a mandate to ensure the reliability and security of the western interconnection. And that's our footprint. We have five sister regions that do the same thing in their own footprints. And together, along with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, we make up what's called the electric reliability organ. NRC delegates authority to the regional entities. So we get our authority from NRC, who in turn gets its authority from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to do the work in the electric sector. Now, WEC does our work through a couple different means. One, of course, is that we enforce, monitor, and enforce mandatory standards, but we also have an analytical component to what we do, and we look at analytical, analytically, we look at risks to the western interconnections, reliability and security. And that's what I'm going to be focusing on today, our analysis of those risks. Next slide, please. Now, when it comes to risk, what looks at a host of different risks,",

        "text": " doing that, and perhaps have at least a high level explanation of the issues being raised by utility board and the responses being made that have been made in writing by both alliance of Western Energy consumers and PGE. And again, I would encourage you to just keep that very brief and high level. And then I think it may be that in order to get into any real discussion, we'going to have to move from the public session into an executive session and we may have to just take a few minutes to deal with the logistics of that. But I do want to, for purposes of the overall public meeting, just get a basic introduction to whats going on here. Do you think you can do that, Madison? Yeah. Yeah. Great. Thank you chairctor and good morning, chaird Decker, Commissioner Tawy. Commissioner Thompson, for the record, my name is Madison Bolton. I'm an analyst in the strategy and integration division here at the PUC. I'm joined today by Betsy Bridgesel for staff. I am here to recommend that the commission adopt staff's recommendations for both regular agenda items three and four, which recommend approval of the rate and credit calculations for 140 customer supplied option capacity, or CSO, in phase one, as well as the 60 CSO capacity in phase two of PGE's green energy affinity rider program or gear. I will begin by addressing the regular agenda item three, the 140 megawatt capacity in phase one. So just some brief background on the program itself. The gear is a voluntary renewable energy tariff, a VRET. It has two customer sections of a PGE supplied option, PSO and a customer supplied option, the CSO. The capacity we're discussing today is part of the CSO portion and that's available to any non residential customer with demand above ten average megawatts. The commission approved phase one of the gear program in order number nineteen, zero, seven, five, as well as PGE Schedule 55 tariff that outlines the calculations for determining rates charged to participants as well as the credits that cost of service customers pay for the value of the resource to the system. These rate and credit calculations are filed for commission review and to ensure compliance with the order and the tariff. So the rate and credit calculations for this resource discussed today, phase one, were actually initially approved by the commission in February of 2021. However, there has been new renegotiations of the resources PPA and with that, PGE has updated components of those rate and credit calculations. So these components capacity valuation analysis updates updates to the price curves from PGE's most recent request for proposal and the resources generation profile all impact the energy and capacity credit value accordingly. So staff's review of the rate and credit calculations did raise a couple of complications that I can speak to before we have to move to a confidential session. First, PGE recalculated the effective load carrying capacity for, or the ELCC is what I'll refer to that as, and it used a battery as the lowest cost resource that would be avoided by this phase one capacity. This change in capacity valuation raises some questions about how that analysis should be updated going forward, especially in the context of Oregon's decarbonization legislation. It's a larger conversation needs not to be limited to this filing, and I'll just note that some of the issues discussed today only represent some of the capacity valuation issues moving forward. So with this renegotiation of the original PPA, staff is concerned that PGE has picked certain aspects of capacity valuation practices, but not considered the entirety of the general capacity investigation findings from docket number um 2011 additionally, these changes that are taking place in this filing have not been examined in the context of PGE's new integrated resource plan, which is supposed to take place later this year. Staff feels that it's important that these capacity evaluation changes are investigated in a more rigorous and comprehensive process, and mainly to ensure that PGE is not picking certain changes that would insulate a VRE participant from effects of renegotiations, especially at a time where cost of service customers are being exposed to such a large transition to meet House Bill 2020, one's emission targets and other objectives. So really here, staff just wants to make sure that we're investigating these kinds of capacity ev valuation changes in a more comprehensive process, considering these updates across all voluntary products, not just limited to specific changes in select programs. So until we can investigate those valuation changes more and we have results from PG's new IRP, staff has recommended that PGE use the ELCC value currently agreed to for qualifying facilities under Purpa, setting that at 8.5%, this is lower than what PGE proposed in the ELCC value for this filing at 10%. Staff believes this consistency with established valuation practices is important right now until further investigation can take place. Secondly, I'll just note that some of the changes to the terms of the",

        "text": ". Am I getting the gist of that correctly? Is there any more detail that exists in the plan about how that would occur that you want to share to. Yeah, absolutely. That's a great question. I'm going to turn to Sean Foster, an expert on transmission system. Thanks everybody. Good to see everybody again. So, with respect to south of Austin, it's a WECC major path and a flowate on Bonneville system. And it is one that is critically important to load service for PG. As you model transmission service requests. Well, let me read back up. As Bonneville models transmission service requests on their system that want to deliver to PGE, there is quite literally no point on Bonneville system or beyond that to bring an incremental resource to our system that has a non dom minimis impact on south of all ##on and so in order to bring any new resource to bear, you have to. Or that resource will impact the south of Auston flowgate. And that flowgate is heavily constrained from a transmission capacity perspective. And so in the IRP document, I believe there's a table that was included that where PGE effectively went and mined data, mined the transmission service request and Bonneville s queue and added up effectively all of the transmission service requests that are out there and what impacts they have to the individual flow gates on BPA system. And so in that one of those flow gates is south of Allon. And so the reality of the matter is, to the extent that we need to add these new resources, and those resources will be remote from our system, there's no delivering those new resources to PGE that does not impact south of Boston. So in terms of what it means for moving forward is it's going to explore options to bring incremental capacity to that flowgate, whether that be. Be a joint PGE BPA project, whether that be PGE, something else. You know, one can go back and look at the various studies that have happened in the past as part of Bonneville's no build decision on the I five corridor project, et cetera, to look at some of the legacy work. Most of those studies are all old at this point, and the world has changed a little bit. So we need to go through and refresh that and undertake an effort to identify what's going to need, what's going to take to bring in incremental capacity to that flow gate. Because again, it's just absolutely critical to PG's ability to serve load. Okay, I'm sure more to come on that. I think the nature of my question is just kind of, are you talking about, are you sort of setting up acknowledgement of some kind of action that PGE is explicitly taking, or are you looking to solve this through the RFP? Insofar as the resources that you're bringing in need to have achieved some transmission from Vnille to get to you? So that's just the kind of institutional, procedural thing I'm trying to understand here. Yeah, absolutely. More to come there. Yeah. And I guess from a portfolio analysis perspective, the question we were trying to answer is, if you did this, would there be a benefit? And analysis clearly shows, yes, it would be beneficial if we could have more access across BPA system. How that gets incorporated into an RFP is a very good question as to what the requirements are for transmission, whether it's bringing or is there, is there something else that should be included as sort of a infrastructure for that r if be? I think that's an appropriate question. Good enough for today. That's. I just want to make sure I wasn't missing something in this document that signaled an answer to that question. Got other questions for the company? Can I ask a timing question about the load forecast? So I see youre taking the building electrification assumptions out of the DSP process. And I guess Im wondering or have lost track of whether that DSP process, how much of the natural gas clean CPp regulation was in place, or included in that DSP analysis, or if this is another place where the world has changed since weve had a set of outputs. And so maybe this is a lower end of what, what we might see, or at the very least of our caast that might be refreshed at some point. Yeah, that's a really good question. So let me just start with, in an IRP, you're always going to have vintage problems just by the quantity analysis that. So we used in the IRP a forecast from March of 2022 for a load forecast, but we also considered additional higher load forec forecast. And what would the impact be? The DSP forecasts are pre inflation Reduction act either summer of 2022 and so constructed before that, and so they are dated. We're looking into what it would take to update both load forecast, those DSP forecasts, and, and other more routine data, vintages in this docket to refresh that",

        "text": " see we're getting a lot of resources in the t for that bre. Thank you. Yeah. Before I turn this over to the engineers, I'll just start out by saying that both the inadvertent export screen and the line configuration screen were both a part of the energy storage interconnection toolkit. I put the link in the chat, I filed it in the docket in March, I believe, the day after we published it with Epi. And that is one of the national standards that I've been referring to. And also there was a question in the joint utilities rabine about where many of the redline. Where many of the new definitions came from, and most of the new definitions came from that energy storage toolkit as well. And then the last thing I'll say about this is, I believe I first presented, or midhot, actually first presentvented this inadvertent export screen on a slide in our first workshop. Was that in August or July? I believe so. I appreciate that it's a complex equation, but the utilities have also had it for a very long time now. But I'll turn it over to my engineers now. Sorry. It was. But I can. Yeah, I mean, I would basically just direct you to the write up of this issue in the batteries report. There's again ep pre research that we looked at to say that basically there's not going to be any scenarios under, I think it's 300 kw with the threshold that you could actually cause a change in voltage, more than 3%. But yeah, the idea is just that if you could cause a rapid voltage change, more than 3%. Given this somewhat, we could have made it simpler, but it'a fairly accurate equation to determine what the voltage change would be. So, you know, if it's greater than 3%, then you'd have to evaluate it further to see if it actually would cause that rapid voltage change. That's the standard in it. This is Mike Beanland again. One of the issues I have with a, the 3% screen is that it's applied as a screen on the assumption that the generation trips offline, which is really an abnormal condition, not a normal operating condition. And in most cases, not even the utility can maintain a 3% voltage limit during an electrical fault. So the real question is, what is the intention of this? Is that 3% screen, is that a normal operation of the generation facility or is it truly tripping of that generation facility offline? And if it's normal operation of the facility, if the facility is being allowed to operate in a, in a voltage control mode, wouldn't that obviate the need for a 3% screen because of the fact that the generation might lose real power output, but it could vary its reactive power output and actually regulate the line voltage. And in some cases, utilities are having projects do line voltage regulation. In some cases they don't want it, but it does put a wrinkle in it. And the way that 3% screen is implemented. Thank you, I can respond to that, Mike. So this is not the typical screen that, well, I don't know if there's a typical screen, but it is common for utilities to apply a 3% evaluation like you're describing in supplemental review in lieu of flicker evaluation. That might be what you're referring to there. And some utilities. Yeah, assume that the system goes from zero to 100% or 100% to 0%, which is, as you mentioned, not the case in normal operation. And especially for a solar array that would normally be you like 30% or a total 70% change, something like that. So, but what this screen is only looking at is for those systems that are export limited. So they're using some sort of control device to limit their export and they may introduce inadvertent export. So it's only for systems that could introduce inadvertent export. And inadvertent export means that they're load following. But we're assuming, we're making a conservative assumption that all of the load at that site drops off. And it's also conservative in the assumption that the nameplate rating, the entire nameplate rating of the system could serve that load. So it's basically the difference between the export and limitation. And the nameplate rating could inadvertently be exported for some period of time and that's what would be causing, causing the voltage change. So it's not the entire nameplate rating of the system, only for those systems that do have those. Sounds good. Thank you for clarifying that. I'm thinking that unless there any more questions or comments about this, it might be a good time to take a break. I note that I'm only one min it off from Ted's scheduled time, so good job to all of us. I did just want to say before we do that, that, you know, the joint utilities are working really hard on this and in good faith and have spent a",

So if there's aired, if there s a change in the interconnection handbook that would impact the Oregon rules, that cannot be done until the rules are changed. If they're proposing a change in the interconnection handbook itself, then that could go through a process. And we've proposed a specific process which would provide notice to as many people as possible that would be potentially impacted. And here the concern is that there can be interconnection handbook changes that people are not made aware of people that are impacted, and they make informed business decisions based on what an interconnection handbook says. And they go out and they, for example, get land use or make buy equipment, and then they approach the utility. And the utility might say, well, our standards have changed and they haven't published it in the handbook. Or if they have published it in the handbook, it was done at a time in which was after the last time this developer looked at the handbook. So we want a more robust public process where the utilities will file. This would be an informational filing the interconnection handbooks with the Oregon PUC and they'll propose changes and they'll provide notice of when comments would be due. And then we think they should provide actual notice to all interconnection customers or applicants. So anyone who has an interconnection agreement that's being constructed or that interconnection has already occurred, they get actual notice of it so they can know how things might change the next time they want to do an interconnection upgrade or make a change, as well as all applicants. So anyone who'submitted. An application, you're going through the process. You should know if there's a possibility of there being changes to the interconnection handbook which could change the upgrades. You don't want to be in a process of an informational or a feasibility study. You get that information back, the interconnection handbook changes, and then the next study comes back with different requirements because the utility has changed its process in that intervening period of time. We propose that there'd be a 60 day period before anything goes into effect or the utilities can do anything based on a proposed interconnection handbook revision. If there's no comments, then the utilities can move forward with their updated handbook. But if there are comments an interest party wants to challenge the interconnection handbook changes, then that could go to the commission for a formal determination on whatever the challenge or objection is before the utility is allowed to make changes to the interconnection handbook. So you have the commission specifically approving something in that circumstance. But if there is no challenge, then there's no presumed reasonness or legality. We'd maintain the current status quo in which just because the utility has it in its interconnection handbook does not mean that it is per se reason. We know there's some commission decision on decisions in certain cases about the meaning of the interconnection handbooks. We're not proposing any changes to that process. But what we don't want is the fact that the utility filed it and nobody at that time challenged it to change the current presumptions and status quo regarding the appropriateness, legality or reasonableness of any changes. So that summation is our proposal. We know that the utilities proposed something a little bit different, far less of a rigorous process. And Ireec has also made a proposal. We're happy to discuss any of the details, answer questions, and it would be great if we could reach some sort of consensus on this. If there's smaller changes or other ideas that people have, we're open to discussing them. Looks like Yokai has a question. Yoki. Sorry. Yeah, good morning. Thanks, Aon. It's good to see the trade associations and developers perspective on this. I think that what you're proposing is fairly consistent with what Ire was thinking and is, and to the extent it requires minor modifications to what we had proposed, I think we would be amenable to that. And I just want to highlight one thing that I think is particularly important, which has come up in the context of earlier workshops, which is the statement that any upgrade should bring the distribution system to the operational standard that's described in the interconnection rules or the interconnection handbook. And having that as kind of a transparent public standard I think is really good policy and really important, especially considering our discussions around exactly what threshold is being used for limited generation feeders today. As some of you who were in the earlier workshop may recall, ir rec kind of looked through the dockets to see what was the standard being used. And it was our understanding that it was a 90% threshold that was being used at the substation for the limited generation",

        "text": " locates. After two attempts he was unable to connect me, but did review the notes and pictures provided by the locator who visited the site and Matt stated, quote, I see no reason why they could not have completed this. The locator had enough access to park, visit the site, and take photos, but not actually to perform his duties. Sounds kind of strange. I had mentioned that this is a very common occurrence as we receive emails of this nature on a regular basis. Matt went on to tell me that they USIC has been having problems up and down the west coast and particularly in Oregon, with maintaining proper staffing and cannot keep up with their contractor requirements with the utilities in which they locate for. He also stated that due to being overwhelmed, many employees have made it practice to simply close out tickets with bogus reasons such as no access, simply because they do not have times to complete them within the time set forth in the Oregon dig laws. The biggest problem, other than the fact that they were blatantly closing ballot dayate tickets without proper cause, was the fact that I was not shocked to hear this information. One would hope that incidents like these are rare, but sadly, this type of activity has become regular practice. Situations like this where we get delayed, inaccurate, or even no service from utility operators or contract locators on D tickets is far too common of occurrence. This is happening every single day on multiple tickets across the state on what I would venture to guess, dozens of tickets. These missing or rushed and inaccurate marks put our employees in significant danger when we are trying to perform our job duties to the best of our capabilities. They lead to damages of existing utilities which put workers at extreme risk, cost ratepayers money for repairs, and lead to significant delays on countless projects which ultimately trickles down, pushing the cost again to rateayers and taxpayers in my hands here I hold a file of well over 100 documented occurrences over just the last seven months of notifications from utility operators and locate contractors that they were unable to complete their lawful requirements of a D ticket request either on time or at all. These are just written communications and does not account for the daily phone calls our project supervisors get stating the inability of the same entities to fulfill their contracted and lawful requirements. Those hundred documented occurrences are just for my single company. My fellow NUA members on this call all have their very similar own file highlighting this problem. I won't sit here today and say that the excavator industry is perfect. There are certainly strides that need to be made with improved compliance on the end on our end, and that is something that Nua is extremely invested in. However, is the belief of Nua that there is an extreme failure of the utility operators within the state to properly manage their locators and the contracts they have set forth to follow theegon dig laws. We feel the evidence is plain as day to see they have skin in the game just as much as as contractors do. However, they don't seem to really care to monitor the performance of their subs, identify any issues or work to improve. Instead, they continue to operate in the same fashion they have act almost with impunity, with little to no accountability to the stakeholders who theego organ dig laws most effect I'll end my testimony today with a simple request. NUA and our member firms request a meeting with this commission and its representatives to further discuss the issue, present our documented evidence of the problem, and discuss ways that our stakeholder group can work with the PUC and its members to help further highlight the problem and work towards solutions to raise the bar for safety across the state. Chair Decker, Commissioner Tani, thank you for your time and consideration. I'm happy to answer any questions. We can't really engage on this today, but I thank you for bringing this important issue to our attention, and I think your constructive suggestion for a next step is well received. Thank you. I appreciate it. Okay, let's move to the consent agenda. Name ter Decker this is Commissioner Tawi, and I movely adopt the motions that'outlined in each staff memo on the consent. I concur. The motion carries and the consent agenda is adopted. As I said at the beginning of the meeting, we're going to be taking the regular agenda. First, I'll call up Ted Drennin from PUC staff to introduce where we're at in UM 2032, which is essentially reviewing the compliance filings by the utilities. Go ahead, Ted. Good morning. Chair Decker and Commissioner Tanei. For the record, I'm Ted Drennan with OPUC staff. I'm joined today by staff counsel Stephanie Anderss. Today I'm here to recommend the commission approved the Energy Resource Interconnection service, or ERIs, proposal for qualifying facilities made by Idaho Power, Pacific Corps, and Portland General Electric.

        "text": " cbres, and we're looking towards, could you advance the slide one more? We're aspiring to meet as much as 25% of our peak demand using distributed energy resources. That's highlighted on this next slide as well when we're looking at a virtual power plant, which we're looking to develop as we go forward. So a virtual power plant would coordinate both our utility scale and distributed energy resources to meet this demand. So in the IRP, we assume a perfect coordination when we're looking at capacity, a virtual power plant with, and would enable that would allow the company to have that next slide. Just looking at the questions that we use portfolio analysis to try to answer. So in portfolio analysis, generally, you construct a set of resource options and from that set you select a single preferred portfolio. And this, in this, this iteration of the IRP, we looked at first, what are the questions that we have to answer with our portfolio analysis? So, emission redjection trajectory towards 2030, how to maximize community benefits, what do CBR's do for you? What do transmission expansion options allow and what is required? And how should we consider this energy efficiency and demand response? And so because those were the main questions we were trying to answer, we said, okay, let's just try to answer those questions specifically. And so for each, we created a set of portfolios to try to answer, to try to determine what is the best way from a resource planning perspective, how to, how to achieve all the goals that we're going for with this set of questions, and then develop a preferred portfolio based on those six answers. So our preferred portfolio is literally just, okay, look at the set of answers. Okay, how do we build a portfolio that does those specific things as mentioned before on the next slide. Next two slides. The regional solutions and partnerships are going to be incredibly important as we go forward. Working together with stakeholders as well as other utilities and other governments will be necessary. We are or is one single grid and sharing of the benefits and the cost of resources might be necessary. As we consider these reliability and decarbonization targets, the next next slide just looks at how transmission could flow into those regional solutions. The reality is there's virtually no transmission available across BPA system. PGE being geographically dependent on BPA system to move generation from off system locations to or load will be critical. And so we're looking at the pathways that could move us forward. There really is no way to meet our mission targets, at least from a modeling perspective right now without some development in the transmission area. The problem is transmission is there's such a large lag time in transmission identification to actual energization. And so we're looking at ways to accelerate that development. We're committed in the next slide. We're committed to, you know, a future where all our customers and communities can thrive. And so we feel that we have a fairly unique responsibility to address climate change as well as historically underserved communities. And so we're looking into ways, both the cost and the benefits side of resource generation to mitigate the impacts as we go forward. Because again, these cost and reliability and decarbonization trade offs will disproportionately har gets customers in our service territory. And so we're committed to working with groups to figure out the best way of both mitigating those impacts and making sure that they are appropriate given the historically undersering of a portion of our communities. And then this last slide just reiterates something that I've said before, is that the federal investments, both the Inflation Reduction act and the Infrastructure and Investment Jobs act, provide a substantial resource for us, and we're aggressively pursuing opportunities in both of these to mitigate that customer impact and develop solutions that work both for our customers and the region. Okay, that is the end of the presentation. The but four of us, myself, Kristen, Sean and Earon, are here for any questions that you have. And, yeah, look forward to the discussion. I guess my first question is just somehow you talked about slides six. Can we go back to slide 16? Somehow you talked about this so fast, I wasn't sure you even talked about it. Can you help me understand, is this virtual power plant concept have some sort of financial kind of resource acquisition element here, or is this just kind of like a discussion of how distribution system resources are going to be harnessed to contribute to system capacity? Yeah, absolutely. That's a great question. So there's no ask in the action plan for anything surrounding the virtual power plan itself. There are resources in the action plan that could be integrated into a virtual power plant. Specifically, the demand response and other distributed energy resources could be integrated into a virtual power plant. In the IRP, we are kind of assuming that there is some perfect coordination of all those resources to be able to meet our system needs. And so a virtual power plant is something that could enable that coordination. And so",

Okay, and the next person I see on the list is Lisa Arkin. ##kay perfect. My name is Lisa Arkin. Lis a a r k I n. Thank you, chair decker and commissioners, for the opportunity to testify. First of all, I want to urge the commissioners to reject all points in northwest Natural's rate increased proposal until about three years ago, I was a northwest natural. Oh, excuse me. Until about three months ago, I was a northwest natural gas customer. My gas fired furnace malfunctioned and stopped working suddenly in the middle of December. When the furnace servicing company came out to see what was wrong, they said the furnace had probably not worked very well for a long time. This furnace was likely leaking low levels of carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide in my home, and that could have accounted for my sudden onset of asthma about two weeks ago. So it was time for a new furnace. But I did not want to put in a new gas furnace and I switched to an electric heat pump and now the air quality in my home is clean and I have stopped coughing. Burning fossil fuels in our homes is not an amenity as northwest natural would have us think. It is a system that introduces high levels of nitrogen dioxide, hydrocarbons and air toxics into our homes where we live, sleep and raise our families. So I am here tonight to request that the commission reject this proposal to raise rates and instead, please build upon the direction you gave northwest natural's integrated resource plan to consider and incorporate electrification into the utilities decarbonization strategy. Northwest naturals rate increase is meant to expand their system and adopt risky schemes that will not decarbonize their system as they claim. For example, northwest Natural fals claims that it can meet its decarbonization obligations by adding hydrogen blending into the natural gas system. These unproven resources are not only expensive, they are dangerous. I'm glad I'm no longer going to be a guinea pig for northwest natural to test their scheme for hydrogen blending into residential gas lines. My 60 decade old home with its old pipes and fittings would have been vulnerable to the damage that hydrogen can cause to pipe infrastructure. Hydrogen causes britrtilization and degradation of older pipes, which could lead to disastrous leaks and explosions. Please do not allow northwest natural to saddle greatayers with the cost of expanding their gas system for decades to come when we must reject more fossil fuels in our homes. The testimony from contractors about housing affordability is a red herring. My home is safer and my bill for heating water and my living space is cheaper than ever. I ask the commissioners to recognize and reject the false solutions touted by northwest natural and instead move towards clean electrification and a new era of energy generation. And I thank you for your work and for considering my testimony tonight. Thank you. Okay, and the next person on the list is Brian Stewart. Hello. My name is Brian Stewart. That's Brianstewarti, AM, co founder of Electrify now. We're a volunteer organization dedicated to promoting the benefits of electrification to homeowners and energy utility customers. Chair DECR and commissioners Tani and Perkins thank you for the opportunity to testify. In order to meet climate targets and ensure we can continue to thrive here in Oregon, we need to stop expanding the gas system and begin to dismantle it. And this is because of the simple reason that there is no viable method to decarbonize the gas system. So the more we build, the bigger the problems we will be in the future. This means ending line extension allowances and subsidies for new gas connections and carefully scrutinizing any gas infrastructure investments. Since these assets are certain to become stranded assets as",

But this simulation only considers the dark blue balancing areas. To join Edam, we are splitting pack west into a Washington portion because they charge for carbon and the rest of Pacific or west and we'll have some more detail on that. Next slide please. By 2030 you have a very decarbonized resource mix. This just shows the installed capacity in the Edam footprint. You see that we have load of about 70 80,000 mw, but we have about 200,000 gigawatts. I'm sorry, with about 200 gigawatts of resources, half of which, more than half of which are hydro, wind and solar, including some offshore wind. You can see there's dispatchable resources that significantly exceed the peak load. Those dispatchable resources as a SL leveliver of coal, a lot of gas, nuclear, which of course isn't terribly dispatchable or flexible, but we have a lot of battery in the footprint. Then of course hydro and pumped hydro. Next slide please. Edam has a resource efficiency test to make sure that everyone participates on a daily basis has sufficient resources. We previously analyzed the resource efficiency test with the consulting group e three in the feasibility study. But for this study we did an exp post analysis to confirm that all the ass soon participants had enough resources every day so they wouldn't lean on other participants. Transmission is one of the design aspects in Edam that's a bit complex. There are three buckets of transmission that we considered in the simulation as well. Bucket one is transmission that people have or need to reserve to support resour efficiency. Bucket two are other transmission contracts that people already have, long term contracts. And then bucket three is Sor, the unsold transmission that can be purchased on a daily or hourly basis. We have assumed that both bucket one and bucket two, meaning the existing transmission rights that people already have, would be added into Edam, donated, so to speak. And the owners of these transmission rights that are contributed to EDam would then get Edam congestion and transfer revenues in return. Of course, the sum of all transmission use cannot exceed the total transfer capability that we have on the contract path between entities because the transmission rights are contract path rights. And then of course none of the power flows can actually exceed the physical limits of the underlying transmission system. Next slide please. Brief note on how we model greenhouse gas. Edam has unit specific greenhouse gas accounting. We have simplified that into unit type specifics so all the coal plants have so emission rates, all the gas plants cts higher than ccs, and then we have of course non emitting resources, of which the west has many that wouldn't have a greenhouse gas hurdle. This is an illustration for California, but the same setup is also done for Washington. For for Oregon. We have not modeled a greenhouse gas charge. We have assumed that the resource mix that we have taken from Pacific course 2021 IRP would be used to satisfy the Oregon clean energy policy requirements. Next slide. Greenhouse gases in Edam are considered against the baseline. So Edem has this design element called the reference cycle. It's basically a cycle where the outside, the outside greenhouse gas area of Edam is dispatched separately from the greenhouse gas area. The greenhouse gas area is allowed to export into the non greenhouse gas area, but the non greenhouse gas area is not allowed to export into the greenhouse gas area. This creates a baseline for the non greenhouse gas dispatch. And so if there are any clean energy resources that are needed in a non greenhouse gas area, those would be in that baseline and those resources could no longer be reshuffled. And so for imports into the greenhouse gas area, it's a little bit complicated, but it's basically just creating a baseline to make sure that we don't have resource reshuffling where one balancing area might import coal and export its own clean energy resources into the greenhouse gas area. Because this reference cycle will tell us that these resources are actually needed in each balancing areas, so cannot be used for market exports into the greenhouse gas areas. So if that was a little complicated, but unfortunately it is a little bit complicated. No doubt. Just a simple question. When you say greenhouse gas areas, you're talk, talking about areas that have sort of, that are pricing greenhouse gas emissions. That's right. When we're talking about the states that impose a charge for carbon, California and Washington specifically. Next slide please. Hydro is a big, the resource in the west. Of course, we've modeled an average hydro year that's slightly less than the 20 to 2020 average WECC Hydro resources. Most of these hydro resources are used for load following and are not necessarily market flexible. But I think about ten to 20% of the hydro resources can",

This is a rulemaking hearing teleconference in AR 631. We are on the record and this hearing is being recorded. So, as noticed, the purpose of today's rulemaking hearing is to hear oral comments on a number of proposed new rules. Those proposed new rules are in OAR 8600, two nine, and the specific rule numbers are 0005-0010-0430-0440 0450-0460-0470-1200 1210-122-0123 and 0124. All members of the public are invited to provide oral comments today or written comments or February 10, 2023, or both. As this rulemaking hearing is legislative in nature, there will not be an opportunity for participants to ask questions of each other. The commissioners or I may ask questions of the current presenter or of another presenter. Our intention today is to take issues in the order presented in the agenda. It will simplify our review to have comments on particular issues grouped together. Participants may comment on more than one item in the agenda. In the section where we have comment from stakeholders on specific issues, we did call out particular questions we were especially interested in, but we're not going to limit your comments in that portion to those questions. So, for instance, when we get to the damages item, you may make any comments you have on damages, and then at the end of that, there can be additional comments on other issues as well as questions from the commissioners if they want to ask those to the ext ##ent possible, and we'll double check the zoom settings to make sure this is something that everybody can do. We ask that anybody presenting rename yourself so that you have your name followed by the party you are representing today. If you can't do that, please raise your hand right now and we'll make sure the zoom settings are changed so that you can okay, it looks like people are successfully renaming themselves, and with that, I will turn it over to commission chair Megan Decker for some opening remarks. My only opening remarks are to welcome everyone and thank you for your continued participation here and for filling out our rulemaking record. Thank you, chair. So I'll give a brief overview, not of the substance of the rules, which are voluminous, but of the status of the rulemaking. We have been working on this rulemaking for quite a while. It's been in the formal rulemaking stage for a year. At this point, we had grouped the issues in this rulemaking into two sets. The commission held a workshop, more than one workshop, I believe, last spring, on the group one rules and provided guidance on the types of provisions it would like to see in those group one rules, and those have been incorporated into the current proposed rules. We subsequently have held both AHD led and commission workshops and solicited comments on the group two rules. However, the commission has not made a final decision on any set of rules. The package that was submitted with this rulemaking notice is the full package of proposed rules, and the commission will ultimately need to approve all of that. The specific issues which we invited comment from stakeholders on in the agenda are those issues where we felt in particular that the record could use further fleshing out. However, we do want to make sure that stakeholders know that they can still make comments on any aspect of the rules, both orally or in writing, prior to February 10, 2023. So with that, we will move on to the first item on the agenda, which is mechanical availability guarantees and minimum deliverability guarantees. And I would ask that anybody who would like to make a comment on this item and the agenda, please use the raise hand function on Zoom and we will make sure to call on you. I I'll call on Adam Lowunney, representing Idaho Power in this proceeding good morning. Can everyone hear me? Thank you. As you mentioned, I am hearing today on behalf comments on behalf of all three, the joint utilities inclusive of PGE and Pacific Corps. So first, I just want to thank you for the opportunity to provide comments. Today. I'll focus my remarks on the MDG issue specifically and try to answer the questions that were posed in the agenda for the rulemaking. Before I get into the details though, I just want to sort of take a step back and recall the context for the minimum delivery guarantee. And for QFs in Oregon taking that are subject to the standard contract, they're entitled to firm prices, and the expectation is that they're going to provide firm delivery of whatever output they prom us. And in that context, the QFS tell the utilities what their expected generation is going to be. The utilities rely on that",

        "text": " clearly and presenting well, I guess what I view as a reasonable process going forward, but I'll stop and ask if commissioners have any questions for staff. Okay, thanks for that summary. And again, thanks for laying it out so clearly that so people can respond to is there any public comment? Please raise your hand if you'd like to comment on this item. If you have any trouble finding the raise your hand button, you can just unmute yourself. But it looks like either or both of Marie Barlow and Jake Stevens would like to speak on behalf of N Sun, so please go ahead. Thanks, chair Decker. I'll let Marie start out and we'll kind of tag team supporting a couple issues to highlight to you guys as we move forward in this process, but thank you. Marie, you want to good morning, Chair Decker, Commissioners Tawi and Perkins, thank you for the opportunity to comment this morning. I just want to indicate that NAn supports the staff recommendation to kind of give a little bit more time on this docket. I think some of the issues are highlighted in PGE's filing. Just noting that PG's taking the opportunity now to change their capacity resource from a gas fired resource to a four hour battery. And as I understand, that's an issue that's been kind of queued up for resolution in them 2000 dockets. And so since PG's decided to take it upon itself to update that now, the additional time will be appreciated to kind of further dig into that. And, and on that same point, PG mentioned this in their filing, that there is kind of a weird dynamic in the avoided cost calculations as they're currently done, where as that capacity resource gets more expensive, it actually kind of has a negative effect on the price, the energy value, because of the way that the methodology has been done in the past. And so I think the additional time will be really helpful to kind of look into that and make sure that we're not doing something that's weird and contrary to logic. So yeah, thank you for that and appreciate, and I'll let Jakeven make any additional comments needed. Yeah, thank you. Marie and chaird Decker, commissioners Hai and Perkins. The battery being added to this filing, I think just want to highlight that to you in a couple of ways. This was a little bit of a surprise filing of, by the way, we're unilaterally changing our capacity resource and we've unilaterally decided that we're going to use a four hour battery and we're unilaterally going to model it with various assumptions that have never seen the light of day. Um, so while, as you've probably heard from us in the past, that we think looking forward to what is the successor to a combustion turbine in that environment is an important question. And I think, as Marie noted, is slated in U 2000 to come up. This was essentially insertion of a major new issue that has never been scrutinized, discussed, modeled. I don't even even know if has had any commission or input besides the conceptual acknowledgement that a fossil capacity unit is essentially out of date and inconsistent with current laws. But should that be a two hour battery, a six hour battery, a ten hour battery? You know, what are all of the assumptions around that? None of those have been scrutinized or discussed, and we were kind of surprised with here. So he. I want to highlight the elements of such surprises and how that kind of back feeds on stakeholders in the process. But b also that at this point, it's hard to even say whether that's appropriate to make this change at all, which is kind of a fundamental question that I think interact, runs through you as commissioners here and or what element should be or if there might be further investigation as we lay into these models. The second thing Marie highlighted this oddity of how the capacity and energy for renewables is priced. Essentially, we have a model that says 100% of energy plus capacity for renewables is a wind turbine. And so when, when that is consuming most of the price as capacity essentially has this effect of being, you know, 100% stack. And so it drives down the energy price effectively in ways that would be inconsistent. So you might end up with, for example, two cent of renewable power because you assume six cents of wind capacity cost. And there's a number of issues that come out of that that is both a, um, 2000 issue, but also now being combined with this battery issue to create some other weir analogs. And we are still analyzing this. So we just want to take the time to bring that to your attention. Third, with respect to, I think, clarifying as relates to the May 1 waiver, I think it'd be useful to clarify here that are we still doing all four of the standard May 1 updates as part of this new May ",

        "text": " In mobile homeowners which have different usage powers patterns, excuse me, for electricity, have a little higher than state average of 1205 kilowatt hours, they could see an increase from 141 to 6141, $60 to $174. And in malure outlying areas, they have a higher than state average kilowatt hour usage and they could see their bill increase approximately 22%. Now when we're looking at this rate case, we're looking at the companies, the base rate. So there the they're asking for 10.7 million. And I've already kind of mentioned what would be that impact to a residential customer. But that doesn't paint the total picture of what the net impact to a customer's bill. You have your base revenue, which like I stated earlier, they have not changed since 2011. And then you have the real impact of the bill. And what that includes is riders. And what I mean by riders is there are other rate schedules that are either credits or they are additional charges that are added on to the bill. For example, if we look at schedule 56, is there power cost adjustment? That's an annual filing each year that allows for more the ability to kind of recognize as changing markets with gas prices and power purchase costs. So that's an annual adjustment that gets to consumers faster that way than waiting for a general rate case. What I'm trying to say is that we have our base rates and then we have all of the sub schedules that are total on your bill. So when we look at everything together, the translation is this rate case, although it's what, 10.7 million, that's where we're getting the 20 314 if it's a standalone on the increase to the base rates in the rate case for residential customer be 26.7% on average. So what are driving these costs Idaho Power has set forth in their rate case that the largest recovery they're seeking for is for capital investments, which represents 51% of the reason cited for the increase. Capital investments can be anything from generation sources that have been brought online since 2011. New transmission, new distribution. It's the company's investment in their infrastructure and their generation to improve reliability. The cost of capital is 1%, which k is of course what the cost is for the company to incur these investments. Operation and maintenance, which is another bucket here at 35, the second largest bucket. Those are the daily operations for the utility. So this would include labor costs. They include gas, they include insurance and all the business expenses that the company needs to operate. Depreciation is accounting methodology that recognizes the cost of the depreciation of a capital investment over the years as it ages. So that represents 14%. So that gives you a pretty high level highie chart of the different components of Idaho's request. Now, if we break it down to those, how that ask is then translated into expected revenue for the company with this increase, again, not surprisingly, the 13.2 is going to be our capital projects transmission plant. There is a 40 megawatt battery installation. The company has included the rates to improve reliability and resiliency, the cost of capital, like I mentioned, operation and maintenance, the debits and credits, depreciation, they get an offset with taxes and then any operating revenue. Offsets, offsets since the last base rate in 2011. And that could be operational savings and other things the company has done to reduce their costs. So of the 10.7, that's how the 19.2% increased the base rates is allocated. As far as looking at it from a revenue perspective. So what is not covered in this? There are some initiatives under House Bill 24 75 with some environment energy justice programs. I do want to specify, though, that Idaho power is proposing an income eligible rate for residential customers. In this rate case, it would be based, it would be a percentage reduction of their overall bill based on a household income. So that is included in this. They haven't had one of those prior. But I just want to reiterate that even though some of these energy justice programs that are mandated by the state may not be entirely included on this, that staff does use an energy justice lens. We're looking at sort of the overall impact to a variety of different customers based on economic and geographic areas, kind of what we were talking about on our three, on slide three. We are looking at that overall impact of any rate changes for customers. Also, there's any broad electrification or environmental programs initiated by the state may not be in here, but we are looking at any green energy projects. We will be reviewed for prudent management and efficient cost control. So there may be components of these in this rate case about staff who works on these and when staff is taking their review and trying to make sure that these are prudent and reasonable costs that the company is asking",

        "text": " export capacity back in the day. But our. What we wanted to flag for folks, like you said, is, you know, we didn't really plan to get into the overall eligibility size caps for net metering. I think everyone knows where that conversation could go and explode. And so we chose not to make changes in what we're putting out to folks, but we also want to have this discussion. Does that sound right? Yeah, that sounds right. Or at least tee it up for folks to consider as they're responding to this. I think acknowledging that there's some sensitivity related to net metering that isn't necessarily related to the physics of interconnecting is a good idea. So I think you're probably right. We probably need to step back and think about the sensitivity of that definition and how it's used here. Hey Eric, brought up earlier when maybe even though I don't like the confusion that this has the potential to cause, if you're goal is really just not to touch the, you know, the, the size limits for net metering, perhaps we can use the newly defined terms of nameplate rating and export capacity to set the tier one eligibility the same as we have done in SGIP at 25 kiloww export 50 kw nameplate. But then the, you know, the section of the rules that establish the net meter and kilowatt limit at 039010 could continue to use the term generating capacity and that could be continued to be calculated as is done today and I guess already went there. And that is that. I think that it is appropriate for the tier one in the NEM ruls to use the same eligibility threshold as in SGIP. Because since you're allowing non residential projects to go up to 2 mw, you could have a non residential project with a nameplate of, nameplate rating of up to 50 and an export capacity of 25. In those situations it would be appropriate for that project to go through tier one interconnection review as opposed. Tier two. Just this is Heidi Caswell. Just a question. I'm confused. It feels like, it feels like the non or the residential number was kind of like a bookend in order to kind of establish a high level value for what would fall within either of those categories. And yi, it feels to me like what you just described essentially then says you're gonna double the expectation in order to allow. It feels like a doubling and an assumption around expectation well beyond what the customer's usage would be for residential. Did I misunderstand something I was not proposing? So let's, let's look at the specific sections of the rule that we're talking about. So there's 039010 which sets the overall size limit for net metering facilities. I wasn't saying that there would be any change there. Residential would still have the limit that's there. Non residential would still have the limit that's there. As shown on the screen here. But when you get into the tiers. So 039030, that eligibility for tier one review using the tier one screens should be the same as the tier one screens that we, the consensus that we reach for SGIP as to, you know, the size limit for using the tier one screens. And in SGIP, we have reached consensus that that would be 25 kilowatt export capacity, 50 kilowatt nameplate rating. Does that clarify? So. Hey Yoki, this is Stephanie. I have a question. So, I'm sorry, I should be more familiar with what you're talking about for the S chip, but so is export capacity different than the nameplate capacity or nameplate rating of the inverters? I thought, I thought when you were determining the nameplate capacity of a, like a solar facility, you would look at the total amount that the facility was capable of exporting, which would be measured at the inverters, right? Is that right? I guess I'm confused as to why you need the two numbers. Wouldn't it just be the one number measured at the inverters? No, because we're revising the rules to include a whole section on limited export and identifying the acceptable export controls. The primary one of which we expect to be used most often is the certified power control system. So if a project uses a certified power control system, which in cases can be the same as the inverter, sometimes an inverter has a power control system built into it, but sometimes it's actually a separate piece of equipment, then, you know, you could, and right, this is all about batteries, right. You could have a 25 kilowatt, you know, you know, solar panel and a 25 kilowatt battery. And then when you add the two together, the nameplate rating, according to the definitions that, you know, we have consensus on for SGIP, would be 50 kw. But because the power control system limits export to 25 kw, then you have an export capacity of 25. So",

        "text": " that there' a method for integrating that work. So those were the overarching comments, and the next slides really go to the specific kind of generalities for each utility. So there are a list of attachments provided for each utility and for Pacific power, um 20,002 oh seven. The attachment a summary generally is focused on things like clarification of information within the plan update, providing information around some of the risk ranking that they did. Explain in greater detail how they manage the relationships with public safety partners, including some of the content like keeping contact lists up to date so that they're usable and useful during emergency. Clarify how CBO's or community based organizations are brought in as part of the solution in order to make sure that communities, whether they are talking about specific needs of certain populations or specific areas that are necessary that that is brought into the thought process of of the utility and with programs such as the battery rebate program, describe its effectiveness and what they plan to do in the future. Additionally, greater discussion around how they're using some of the operational data like outages and other ignition risk drivers, performing root cause analysis and taking that operational data and aligning it against mitigation measures is is another update element that is being requested in the attachment aid. There are more, but this is kind of the general themes in the 2026 to 2028 WMP. What's being asked, and this is very consistent across the three utilities, is its details regarding wildfire risk, analysis of assets at a very granular level, clarifying the risk valuation process or some kind of risk reduction me metric that demonstrates that the right solution was being selected at the right location for a good cost and with a good time of delivery. Further detail around mitigation measures, the costs and the estimated risks that are being reduced by the measure and continuing to advance the coordination and communication with public safety partners, communities and customers and providing content around kind of the maturing that's happening across the industry. Further really focusing on the technology that's being advanced and how that's being adopted within the company to mitigate wildfire risk within um 2002 oh nine, which is Idaho Power? The next slide I think the update recommendations are focused on again, more explanation than anything else around the rationale for the area that was evaluated and how they designate a yellow risk zone versus a red risk zone and whether they are re quantifiable measures that they can discuss that help to demonstrate where the cut line was drawn. Additional details around emergency response command structure that maybe precedes an activation of the incident command system discussing some of the interactions with public safety partners, including the frequency and the messaging for those particular those particular partners and why it's but what led to that being the right frequency? Again, discussion about how Idaho powers using the community based organizations they have relationships with to help their communities be more resilient to wildfire and other risks. Also the discussion of the battery program and how customers can benefit from those resources. Further discussion about the timing and response to findings when inspection and vegetation management programs are conducted, either in risk zones or outside of risk zones and continuing to work with ignition risk drivers and operational data again such as outages to hone in on the events that are the bigger risk areas and then discuss the learnings that have generated from things like the International Wildfire Risk Mitigation consortium or other industry activities, and then again to the 26 20 through 28 WMP. It's very similar with details regarding wildfire risks at that granular level. Identification of risk spend efficiency or whatever the risk valuation method is that demonstrates optimization for risk reduction at cost and time intervals. Detailing the mitigation measures and costs. As a multiate operator within both states or all three states, they have assets in continuing to advance coordination and communication in this maturation group. That is one of the recommendations and again, outlining technology that's being advanced and the benefits that they're seeing for the activities that are underway. And then in the next one, um, 2002 oh eight. Portland General Electric, the WMP update for 2025 would ask them to discuss in greater detail modeling processes and adjustments that are made for things such as climate risk or climate change, short term fuel loading or input from partners that may have resulted, or subject matter experts that may have resulted in boundary changes and how that process is informed, a portion of which is data driven and a portion of which may be more subjectively driven. Also in Portland General Electric'attachment, a request for details for mitigation measures by year with spending level, including estimated cost and units. And this is by expense and capital investment types. Again providing a bit more detail around the emergency respons command structure, how it basically gets ramped up until you, when you've called an incident command or when you've activated nims or the incident command system, identifying interactions with public safety partners, including that frequency and the messaging that's been determined to be best in their communities. Also the leveraging of community based organizations and what has been beneficial for the communities",

We're now going to begin the public comment part of the evening and we're going to hear public comments on PGP's request. It's a little easier than when we were on Zoom last week because we have a microphone and I have a list all you you would like to speak. So just a few notes before we get going. There are many room this evening so we want to make sure we can contrib as many as possible. So think about that as you're giving your comments. There's over 20 people here. All 20 people use three minutes time that hoursolog. Keep that in mind. You can provide a summary of reviews and follow it up with written comments. And if you u can follow up your complete written comments, you can also agree with other commenters. But that's not say we want to any of you provide us with your full comments. I'm going to go down the list. If I mispronounce your name, please forgive me. We will start with bah era rlo. Thank you. So working. Please say your name slowly for the records and the transcribeer. Try that. Why? Well want to report all this? How you all start? My name is Boby Eillian, I live on Gate Road. I lived in Oregon pretty much all my life to remove hello. Okay. My name is Vi Killian, we live on Gage Road and I lived in Oregon pretty much all my life. We moved out to Gate Road about twelve years ago because we liked the beauty there and the privacy and it's still kind of a farming community. I really think that they should put this project somewhere else. I think it's just going to ruin the whole cor of Stafford Road. And I'd like to ask each of you, have you guys driven down Stafford Road quite a few times to see where their proposal is? Good. So I also want to go on record to say that I've got your condemnation before and they're going to have to condemn my property before I will allow them to take it. And then I also will be hiring attorneys to take them to court. Last time I went through condemnation it took about six years. In the end trime I did what they wanted to do, which I thought would totally. Yes. I'm really hoping that maybe you could let us hear win for change, because we're all citizens, we pay our taxes. I really think that this project could be taken and put somewhere else. That's all I have to say. Thanks for coming, commissioners. My name is Sharon Kauffman. I live on 21 eight eight two southwest Stafford Road. I have lived there for the last 48 years. I've seen a lot of changes over that time. Nothing like this. I agree with everybody else's comments that have been made about the fire risks diminish property values. I also wonder about my Internet, which I currently get from the cell phone tower on Boland Roadw. And those lines are going to be hanging right smack in front of my Internet access. But, you know, I appreciate fact that you guys came out to listen to what we had to say and I hope you take it into account. Thank you very much. I'm Susan Vandenberg. My husband and I live at 21892. Staff pro just before e we first became aware of this on July 13, 2023, when we were out in the front yard and saw men in our pasture. I don't know, I didn't notice that they climbed the fencer p through gates, but putting up poles on our property. Nobody came up to top. So I walked down and asked what was about. And they said, well, we really don't know. We think it'had something to do with the power. So we just continued on down the property lines, putting hold up. Two days later we got a packet in the mail from PGE with the information about the easement request. And I have to say we really didn't understand the impact of all that until our neighbor knocked on our dor. Kind of said, this is what this means. Excuse me. A few days later we talked to universal field services, which was the company with the Easman agreement. He kind of explained it. Then PG had a public meeting that we went to which was really nothing more than tables set up. Kind of explaining their different books. Didn't really answer our question. Now, October Tena last year PG reps came to the property. And again, you know, we tried to bring up the question of the property value. We have four poles on our properties. ##rely out in front of our view. House is situated in west and north, has amazing views. So we have four right out our kitchen, right off our deck. And the poless right now",

        "text": "Good morning, everyone. Today is January 18, 2024, and we are here for a special public meeting of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. We're here in docket number LC 80 to talk about our decision on PGE's 2023 Integrated Resource Plan and Clean Energy Plan. Today's meeting and are the time that we have scheduled this time next week, or to conclude our decision making, or the culmination of a long process in which all of you in this meeting have played an important role in advancing the dialogue and helping us understand the issues that you think are important. I want to say a little bit about our agenda today. The first thing that I'll say about our agenda is that we are going to proceed today with maximum flexibility. It goes without saying that it has been and continues to be a very challenging time for people in our state. I know in particular that many people's children still don't have school. Happy to see them on video if need be, or we're happy to have you email the email address listed in the agenda and let us know that you have to drop off and would love to give comments at this particular time. Just please stay in communication using that email during the meeting. I want to also recognize the moment that we're in here by just expressing a public thanks to the liney crews and emergency responders that are still out there after many, many, many hours of work and very few hours of rest, and just appreciate what that takes and how serious and important the business that we're all engaged in is. I also want to express sympathy to everyone affected in small and large ways by this event, and also recognize the larger tragedies that this event has brought to our state, this is, for me, a very difficult and strange time to take up PGE's CEP, honestly. And while our decision, of course, will be based on the really robust record of comments and the dialogue that we'll have today, there's something that's on my mind about this matter coming before us at this time. And. And it's just that running the system is hard and increasingly expensive as we mitigate and adapt to climate change and extreme weather events, whether related or unrelated. At the same time, this weekend has had obvious impacts on the service territory. It's also been a weekend where the entire northwest region has seen reliability alerts and significant price excursions. Really, really high prices. It's a reminder that we will not and cannot get through these events yet without the whole diversity of resources in our portfolio and then some. And there are no easy answers to any of this. But I guess I just wanted to reflect at the beginning that the purpose of these planning exercises is to really ask the hardest questions about how we're going to go forward under these challenging circumstances and to work constructively together to get to the best answers we can about the trade offs and the actions that the company is going to take. And I understand that we'll be talking about some ultimate yes or no decisions, and those are attractive and they're important signals. But what's important, I suppose, to me about these planning exercises is that we are seeing adaptation and progress. I think that the work that all of you have done to poke and prod and push whatever our decision ends up being on any points, really has been in service of progress toward meeting these extremely challenging times in the best way that we can as a state. So with that, I'll note that I'll pass it over to Commissioner Tani for some welcome and opening remarks. And Commissioner Tani, when you're finished with that, I'll get a little more serious about how we're going to take up the agenda and make sure that I give a chance for people to that haven't been able yet to contact the administrative hearings division to let me know about any timing issues or desires to comment that may not have been communicated so far. Commissioner Tani, any introductions or welcome that you want to make here? Thanks for that. Well, I would, of course, start with echoing your thanks and recognition of the BL. Crews and emergency responders have been putting in enormously long hours middle of last week, as saw the storm approach and all of the work thats been done over the last few years to harden the system. Counterfactuals are very hard to identify, but weve been proving a significant spend on a wide range of hardening actions, and well see what the after action reports show in terms of results as we grapple with the decisions here. And I do want to really appreciate the hard work that so many advocates have put into engaging in this docket. And it's wonderful to see that growing capacity and engagement of new voices and advocacy in the IRP. I really appreciate that. That's the comments. Excellent, and I'm looking forward toing hearing more today. I think it's important to be grounded in what planning in this dynamic environment really can give us. And functionally, I think of planning as very much an adaptive management pursuit. We're trying to see what",

        "text": " would fit within all of our portfolio by, like, say, the end of 27, it would be probably the early 2030s before we'd be able to get a larger project. So just kind of like stringing those serial timelines along. Getting a pilot project looks like it would be a pretty good approach to understanding how long duration storage would fit within the rest of our portfolio and really provide a lot of value. So that's something we'd like to pursue and looking for opportunities there and then going to the bottom go. Sorry. A question on that is there are lots and lots of different long duration energy storage technologies being proposed out there. Have you mean, I assume you would conduct an RFP for that? Or do you have anything to say about how you would select among the various emerging technologies if different from an RFP? Yeah, that's a really good question. Chair Decker. We. We're trying to figure that out right now. So I think the most likely scenario to something like this would be a Doe grant of some sort through one of those most recent bills that were passed. And so that's our primary, the primary thing we're focused on is, yeah, a Doe grant. And then where would this project be best located to maximize our opportunity to win such a grant, while also maximizing the benefits that all of our customers would experience, and maybe the customers specifically located near that long duration storage pilot project. And so that's kind of what will help us identify how long or what type of project it would be. Are we talking 10 hours or are we talking 100 hours type of storage? And that will be kind of dependent on the use case and where it would be located. So we're kind of just starting those explorations right now. What will testing one technology among many that might emerge as the most commercially viable on your system show you that modeling wouldn't, that modeling wouldn't. I think that would be just how it fits in with all of our various processes and getting our operators and everyone like that familiar. And so as we approach the operating season 18 months out, we start looking at what our needs are and how these various components fit within those. And so we saw historically that it was mostly hydro, coal and gas that we had to fit together. And now with wind and solar and storage, that changes things quite a bit. And so we've modified our processes over the years to handle those of those type of changes. But like a long duration storage is pretty unique and different, especially if it was a multi day type of storage, on how we could shift not only between like heavy load and light load hours, but between weeks at a time, the energy needs. And so that's the starting point. And then getting our operators familiar with how to really maximize the benefits of these and not use them to like a minimum, like minimally use them, I guess, to meet their needs, but also maximize those benefits. So it's really just a learning opportunity. I think we can probably learn a lot with modeling, but it's different once you just get your hands on something and start actually moving all of your equipment and around it to optimize around it and stuff like that. Oay. All right, we need to stop interrupting you and let you, let you flow a little bit here. No problem. So bringing b two h online in the summer of 26 is next. Valmy conversions we already discussed we would be doing that in the summer of 2026, and then acquiring, if economic, a combined amount of wind and solar, as much as 1400 mw or other economic resources was identified, and then we have a wrap. And so we've started modeling kind of a reduced need because of WRP. And we'll continue to look at rap, and, of course, we're participating in that, but we'll be looking at how much we can optimize around the wrap. And right now, we've put 14 mw in there as, as the number two that we've kind of reduced our needs and then bring in that first phase of gateway west online by the end of 2028 is what we're shooting for, for that particular phase. So that's our action plan, all of those various components. Any other questions on that one? Okay, and after that or after that slide, really what we wanted to do is talk about some of the changes made in the IRP and maybe just help address some questions on what may have changed and, and explain the reason for those changes. And so first, we have the reliability threshold adjustment. In the 21 IRP, we were planning toward a loss of load expectation of one in 20 years, or 0.05 event days per year. And are, we did shift that based on feedback from you both, as well as feedback from the Idaho commission and, and other, and staff from each state and stakeholder groups, back to a 0.1 event",

        "text": " for competitive development of this resource, so we think theres quite a bit of value there. Second, we requested a long lead RFP for resources that have had some difficulty competing or are novel in traditional rfps. PG'reply comments indicate that they are planning to issue a request for information, an RFI that may inform a future procurement strategy. We'looking forward to learning more about that planned RFI, but we do continue to believe that there would be value in a separate long lead RFP, given the potential unique value of certain long lead resources, and again the difficulty of comparing sort of apples and oranges in the traditional procurement approach. Third, we requested that PGE not discount the capacity accreditation of resources using conditional firm transmission. We presented an updated analysis performed by grid strategies responding to PGE'earlier, critiques of the preliminary analysis that we had included with our round zero Comments PtE Reply comments continue to disagree with grid strategies, but we continue to stand on grid strategies work as the best existing assessment of the potential effects of conditional firm curtailment on a resources ability to provide capacity to PGE, and continue to recommend that PGE updated its modeling to give full credit to resources connecting using conditional firm transmission. And fourth, we requested certain updates to PGEs methodology for incorporating HB 2021 greenhouse gas emissions reductions into their clean energy plan, with an eye mostly to making those updates in future plans rather than the current plan. Chekr I think he summarized sort of the main takeaway that we were trying to get to in our comments and collaguequy with Sedeshana, but we expect this would be an ongoing conversation, but just essentially want to highlight that getting it right will be really essential, we think, to fulfilling not only HB 2020 one's policy goals, but also the commission's statutory mandate to ensure that the company is taking actions as soon as practicable to facilitate the rapid reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, il just note that there there are some threads that kind of run through all of these items and are difficult to tease apart separately. For instance, again, a topic that you were exploring with commission staff, how do we best plan for rapidly decarbonizing post 2030 grid? It's a challenging one. How do we assess reliability and resource adequacy as the planning and operational paradigm changes to one that relies ever more heavily on variable zero emission resources? Significant part of our round one comments SoU to provide some context, potential direction, explore some sort of emerging best practices on these big picture questions. But we are not going to belabor them here today, except to the extent that you want to get into them, in which case, again, we have some of our outside experts standing ready. We have a short ramp to 2030. Even really a short ramp to 2040. If we're all being honest, I think we can probably agree there. We deeply appreciate the challenge this poses to the company, to the regulators tasked with ensuring that the company meets those targets. And we appreciate both the companies and the commission's efforts to get this rapid clean energy transition right. So having said that, I will stop and welcome questions for renewable northwest staff and outside experts. Yeah, thank you, Max. And again, thanks for just really sort of pumping up this review effort with a lot of different issues for us to consider. I'll turn maybe first to Commissioner Thompson to see if he wants to start with any questions. You're free to pass, but go ahead. I appreciate that. Yeah, I have a couple questions. Max, thanks for, I really appreciated the comments on trying to make some concrete proposals about how utilities can take actions. You know, again, kind of going back to the same topic, I discussed a suggestion of how they can take actions to perhaps start creating opportunities to acquire resources in those out years. So specifically, renewable Northwest proposed a long term RFSP. I noticed in your comments you said that the commission may not need to radically alter its current regulatory processes and paradigms to allow least risk long lead time resources to help meet PGE and other utilities energy and capacity needs in the early 2030. Ireiated the optimism, and I guess I had a couple questions. First, you know, renewable Northwest obviously represents a valuable forum where your members can kind of talk about these issues and then you can put forward concepts. I was curious. Yeah. How confident are you that, you know, long term RFP may in fact break things loose from a developer's perspective and bring certainty? And second, have you had any thoughts about what kind of provisions or terms of a long term RFP would be appropriate to help us feel comfortable that customers are being protected? So, you know, on one end of the spectrum, a long term RFP could say, hey, we want to buy a resource 20 years from now and we'll sign a deal",

        "text": " that if you pursue only one, that the fixed option is preferred. And lastly, OCA is supportive of the flexibility and staff's proposal on QF eligibility requirements. It makes a lot of sense to allow for optionality now as we do not know what the rates will look like, nor do we know the cost of different size and duration batteries. This option will enable developers to design their solar and storage project to be more economically viable. Thank you for your time and I'm available to answer any further questions. Any questions for Jack? Okay. All right, let's hear from the utilities then I'll start with Adam Lowney for Idaho Power and and move on to Zachraala. Hello again. Hi and thank you on behalf of Idaho Power, I want to express again support for staff's recommendation. We largely support their proposal and appreciate that they incorporated much of our feedback into the final product. However, the company has one recommended modification to the staff's proposal, and that is approval to use three different proxy solar plus storage resources to calculate standard prices. Rather than the single proxy resource that's recommended by staff, the effective load carrying capability or the ELCC. For solar plus storage qfs will be highly dependent on the size and duration of the battery. A larger battery and or battery with longer duration will have a higher ELCC, and a higher ELCC translates directly into higher capacity payments once that capacity value is converted into a volumetric avoided cost price. The commission has long recognized that standard prices should appropriately differentiate between qfs with different capacity contributions, and the commission very recently affirmed staff's capacity valuation methodology, relying on the ELCC as the gold standard for determining capacity value. Therefore, Idaho Power recommends that standard solar plus storage prices accurately reflect, to the extent feasible, the best estimate of a QF's capacity value. For that end, Idaho Power recommends three price streams based on the following proxyources staff's recommended proxy a facility with a one to 0.5 solar to battery ratio and a four hour battery, and a facility with a one to one solar to battery ratio and a two hour battery. Using proxy resources, the better match the proposed QF is an easy and straightforward way to produce more accurate pricing. This is particularly important to IDO power, given that the company's active and contracted Orego organ QF capacity is nearly three times its average organ load. To the extent additional proxies can create an administrative burden, that burden falls on Idaho power, and it's one we're happy to accept in the interest of accurate pricing. In closing these remarks, the company would once again thank staff and express our general support for its recommendation, subject to what we believe is a relatively modest but important adjustment. Thank you. I want to ask a quick question here. Maybe it's not that quick. Can you help me understand why you think the premium hours model pricing model wouldn't capture the effects of bringing a smaller battery? Like if I'm bringing a smaller battery relative to my solar size, why am I just not earning fewer of those premium hours? The concern is that that difference in what a smaller battery may earn during those premium peak hours will not necessarily correspond precisely to the difference in the ELCC that that smaller project would have received had its price been based on its capacity value. And so from the company's perspective, rather than sort of speculating that these different variables are going to be perfectly offsetting or close enough to offsetting, it makes more sense to just have three separate price streams that correspond to each of the different to three different configurations so that every QF gets a price that's more specifically tailored to their specific capacity contribution. Oay. Thanks any other questions for Adam? No? Okay. All right, let's hear it from Zach Rgala. Hey, good morning. Chair Decker, Commissioner TNY Thompson. For the record, Zach Reggala, attorney for PacifiCorps and, you know, Pacific appreciates the benefits that storage facilities paired with renewable and non emitting resources will soon deliver over the next decade. We think these resources are going to provide substantial energy and capacity services. And when dialed in to fill the gaps from variable generation, we think it's going to ensure an unbroken supply of power across our system. Know, through that point, our 2023 IRP calls for over eight gigawatts of energy storage. That said, you know, it's important to take stock of where we are. You know, we're at the initial stages for figuring out how batteries work. So questions like how durable are they? How long do they last? You know, do systems work better when paired with two hour or four hour or longer duration batteries? And what's lost when batteries have smaller nameplate capacities compared to the resources they're inter connected with? So we think these are significant questions and we don't have adequate data to draw from to inform utility decision making at this point. I mean, the data we do have we think is likely",

        "text": " calculated a solar plus storage profile for a sort of example, QF version of solar and storage. So how could that resource perform in the avoided cost calculation? The proxy resource is a wind resource. We have in each of our QF avoid cost rates, we have a sample profile for baseload and wind and solar and so on. And so we have a sample solar and storage profile that we've calculated here. And so then maybe just at a high level, can you just explain then the relationship between the credit that occurs for the QF storage in these hours, these the initial calculation of capacity value. So it's derived from a wind proxy plant, and then it's being then applied to the hours that the QFS solar storage is available? Not exactly. I mean, we've calculated this capacity contribution independent of any other resource. Right. It's how much can a solar storage resource, QF that's trying to dispatch during the four hour peak periods, how much of the loss of load events in the data can it cover? And so we've calculated fill up the storage and discharge during the events during the four hour periods. And what's the overlap? And we get 61%. And then in the calculation in the other file, we compare that to the contribution of the wind proxy. So you. The 61% we were just looking at is the contribution of the. Okay, what I just do, hold on a moment. So we just subtract the one from the other and calculate how much extra capacity over and above the wind proxy is available from the solar with storage resource. Okay. And so that's, so again, so its value come. The value of the capacity itself, I take it that is coming from the wind proxy, is that correct? But I mean, I mean, the availability of the capacity is based on the storage facility and what it's able to cover. But the price, if you might say value, is from the proxy. I mean, it's the. How to put this? So we take the firm capacity costs associated with a simple cycle that's this dollars per kilowatt year. Embedded within this wind resource is, is some contribution based on its 41% capacity contribution and the 61% contribution of the solar and storage resource that we just looked at. So the difference between these two is what we're adding on top of these, renewable wind avoided costs. So sort of implicitly, $97 per kilowatt year at a 41% contribution is embedded in these numbers for the wind resource. That's already captured, but we've got more contribution for the solar and storage resource. And so that extra, you know, 20% contribution, the difference times the you, the 97 for a sort of pure capacity resource in the simple cycle. That's the amount of additional value that we're adding to the solar and storage QF resource. Okay, thanks. Thanks for connecting those dots. Yep. And then this calculation, which is slightly complicated, is how many deliveries by the solar and storage resource would occur across the year during the premium peak hours. And like I mentioned, it can't quite fill up the premium peak hours in the wintertime. And so the total availability of the resource, of the solar and storage resource and premium peak is only 93.7% of all premium peak hours. But we take this pot of dollars and spread it across, you know, that expected output in those 4 hours per day, not including Sundays and holidays. So that's what this represents in a dollar per megawatt hour. Very similar numbers, but this is in dollars per kilowatt year. This is in dollars per megawatt hour. And then this capacity adder gets included in the premium peak period, whereas it does not in the off peak period. Thank you. Any other? Go ahead. This is Ryan again. I just wanted to verify and maybe mention this, the solar generation profile used in the solar PL storage resource. That's the same solar generation profile as your fixed solar, I guess proxy, I believe it's the tracking solar, but yes, it's the same QF proxy profile. Thank you. Yep. So here's the avoided cost calculation, and this is an annualr premium peak and so on storage off peak number. But we thought it's important to capture the value across the year of when those loss of load events are occurring. And so we calculated an annual cost. Here we go. We calculated the annual value of the resource and how much it would be compensated based on the generation profile that we had in each month. And we used market prices in the monthly across the different months to spread the value across the year. And that way we get closer to what the value is to customers in any particular month during the premium peak and the solar storage off peak periods. Because of the differences in the generation profile across the year, it doesn't quite add up. And so we had to make an adjustment so that the total compensation with",

        "text": " on you as you're looking at it. So I would do my best to explain at least concepts, if not some of the numbers we're trying to get to here. So, you know, unlike if you were to envision, like I said, in the 2023 IRP, we just did a system run and just added small scale renewables on top of that. That was kind of the overall approach. By blending these two together, we ended up taking these Oregon. So when I say in Oregon specific study, we layered in emission limits across the system as if Oregons to hit 80%, 90%, and 40% reductions for the system as a whole so that we could do an apples to apples comparison to the system resource. So it's kind of as if HP 2021 applied to all of our six jurisdictions, get a portfolio coming out of that when we break both portfolios down to an Oregon allocated share. We still do the Oregon share of both folios to see which resources might be added to the system when we're blending them. But effectively, I want to make it clear that that's how we did that. And so when we did that Oregon specific run, the things in the yellow to the right, within the yellow kind of clear line of the box, but the yellow solid boxes to the right, those are things that essentially were incremental to the Oregon run that was not in the system run. And so they're kind of added as Oregon situs resources. Of course, there's a small scale requirement, all of the energy efficiency and demand response we're assuming or sus to each jurisdiction. And then Oregon still gets the share of the white boxes in the middle when you see we have a total, and then below it, the system allocation, the Oregon and Washington's allocation going left to right where solar wind storage and the natrium demonstration project, those were common. So Oregon share where gets its allocated share of the system resources, the preferred portfolio for those. And then when we looked at the Washington studies as well, we did see some overlap between the Oregon only scenario, the Washington only scenario, where resources were not in the system resource, but shared between the two Oregon and Washington. So you'll see the green bar there, green box that has a battery of 2029, that that is split between Oregon and Washington based off what we were seeing in those studies. And similar for Oregon, we had specific resources just for Washington. And Washington gets its share of system resources that were common between its study and the system study. The big picture, this is kind of a graphical way with some of the actual numbers you through 2032 to show how we did kind of a Venn diagram is how we were talking about it. Where we had system, we had Oregon, we had Washington. And where there was overlap, those were common areas. Where there were not, we had to do something about that and add that as an incremental thing, but adding it to our preferred portfolio so that our overall broad plan accounts for the fact that we will be taking maybe state specific actions to hit state specific policy objectives. Pause there to see if there are any questions. Can you help me understand the purple wind box? There's some wind that is good for the system and good for Washington, but is not needed for the Oregon land. Yeah, I think the part of the reason that is in there that way is the Oregon share. We have the small scale requirement. So we converted Oregon's elements of that to a small scale version of that facility, the small scale, the small scale resource requirement, that's the resource that, that displaces. I think that's right. And we pushed it over to Oregon Sis, 100% because the system model telling us we would do large utility scale as opposed to scale scale, I believe that is what we would have without. Is it oversimplifying to say without a small scale requirement? We would have probably participated in that purple box too. But we could only go as far as what was in the wind box and in the clear wind box because we were filling up our basket with small scale resources. That kind of the way that way to think about it. I believe that's the case. And I would even ask, I know I've got a lot of folks on our team listening in. You know, don't be shy if I'm mischaracterizing it, you know, feel free to chime in. But that's, I believe that is correct. It at least has an influence on it. And, and I will say that, you know, there is, it is very helpful that there was a lot of commonality and it allowed us to pretty easily just make some subjective judgment calls to make portfolios combined to kind of do that Venn diagram approach. I do see this as an area where you, we want to talk through this approach with our stakeholder and through our engagement series, make sure folks",

And with that, that sort of concludes all the introductory comments I had, and I'm happy to answer any questions, either of our reports or anything else the commission wishes. Great. Thank you so much. And if I could characterize your last couple points, it was sort, not only did you talk to the company, AndrT of felt like there was a reasonable enough reason to have these things in there, but also it sounds like you thought they were kind of like, didn't necessarily rise to the level where having a different default prior to negotiation was sufficiently important to make a staff recommendation. Thank you. I think that's right. Chair Decacari. Yes. Any questions? Any additional questions for Pat? No? Okay, why don't we go to the company first and then to NIPSeC, and then we'll see if there's any other public comments. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay? Yes. Good afternoon, Chair Decker, Commissioner Tawi, and Commissioner Thompson. For the record, my name is Adam Lowney, and I'm appearing today on behalf of Idaho Power to request that the commission approve the company's 2026 all source RFP. As you noted, the company is a fast approaching 2026 capacity need that requires sufficient lead time for new resources to be constructed and brought online. To meet that need, the company must expeditiously issue the RFP to the market so that bids can be received and evaluated, shortlist selected and contracts signed in early 2025. Much work remains, but the company is appreciative of staff, the iE, and stakeholder efforts to date to review and generally support the proposed RFP. My brief comments today will focus on staff's supplemental recommendations, except I'd like to first address the prior recommendation from the last public meeting regarding section 8.5 of the form PPA that you discussed earlier with PAT at the last public meeting. Idaho Power agreed to remove that section to address staff's concerns, and so we'll be removing that from the form PPA. So we believe that we will have resolved that issue that was lingering from the original set of staff recommendations. So turning back to the supplemental conditions staff issued last week as outlined in Idaho Powers reply comments that were filed yesterday, the company largely accepts, accepts staff'recommendations, and supplemental conditions. And as outlined today, the three areas in which Idaho Power offered an alternative appear to be acceptable to both staff and stakeholders. In addition to the comments that were filed yesterday, the company also filed a revised RFP that incorporated the supplemental conditions. The filed RFP also includes all other revisions made to date in response to staff, ie and stakeholder feedback, with the exceptions of section 8.5 of the PPA, which we will agree to remove in the next turn of that document. At this point, the company believes it has largely resolved the issues identified by staff, the IE and Nipsey, with the exception of the imputed debt issue discussed in the last public meeting. Therefore, the company requests that the commission approve the RFP today so that it can be issued to the market as soon as possible. Thank you for the opportunity to appear today and the company available for any questions. Any questions for the company? I don't have any questions. I mean, you heard my comment about things like the number of hours for dispatch instructions. I think there was another issue that made me think about that, which is the, I guess round trip efficiency was another one where the maybe too high number was just pulled out in favor of no number. And I just think it's going to affect scoring in some unknown way if there's some sor of really low efficiency number or some kind of complicated long term reduction or something. But I assume, given all these sophisticated people in the room, that that is something you'll figure out. And if there are disputes about that, we'hear about it later. So that's all I have, I think, and chair decker, just to comment briefly, we would agree with your understanding. I would note, I think, particularly on the notification timeline as an example, that's a place where if a particular bid has a price component, for example, that absolutely dependent on a certain period of time for that notification. We would expect that bid to state that fact so that when we're evaluating it, we're where, and obviously bids could have different prices based on different technical specifications of the product they're using. We would account for. Great. Thanks. That's helpful. All right. If there's nothing more for Adam, let's go to NPssec. Good afternoon. Afternoon. Yes. So, yeah, thank you very much for your attention to this. We Nipsey really appreciate staff's consideration of our comments andorporation of many of them, as well as the I and Idaho power since there's been",

        "text": " are plausibly available on the market between now and 20. Basically what we're saying is we don't need cold fusion in our estimates right now. We think we can get the 80% reduction targets met by 2030 using known and again plausibly available technologies. However, when we look at a fully non aming system in 2040, we're seeing an inability to do so. So your major resources, wind, solar and storage, are present too many gaps in generation to meet load. And so we think we need something new in terms of policy or technological development that leads to a change in our systems operation and our ability to meet load without emitting carbon accordingly. You know, kind of falling out of those two things. We think the natural gas plants will continue to play an important role both for PG system, for our customers and our reliability, as well as the region. And so we were planning on maintaining those natural gas plants at a, you know, a full operational level. If you go to the next slide, please. We think the geographic diversity of resources, both in the type and size of generation resources, the diversity is incredibly important. And so while we have looked at in this IRP, at, you know, your traditional regional resources, we've also expanded that analysis to include a Wyoming resource, a Nevada solar resource, to take advantage of the geographic and generational diversity that you would get for such resources. You know, the transmission constraints that we see across region are also similar to what I mentioned before, driving the economics such that your on system resources demand response energy efficiencies CBR, anything you can get on system that doesn't emit carbon is great. And, and so that is driving the entire economics of this, of this analysis. Similarly, kind of, this is all just falling out of the transmission and emission constraints that we now face. Regional markets and partnerships are, could be critical for reliability and cost mitigation. And so we're looking at ways to utilize those regional markets, things like wrap and partnerships across our geographic area, to keep reliability high and cost as low as. Similarly for cost mitigation, these federal, state and local funding opportunities will be critical. The cost mitigation piece is, will be a tremendous pressure for us as we go through to 2030 and utilizing as much as these resources is going to be, is going to be critical. Further, the collaboration with our customers, communities and stakeholders is going to be increasingly important as we really do consider these trade offs that we have and that will be faced going forward. So I can keep going here the next few slides, dive deeper into the IRP. I could pause first for questions, if there are any, or I'm happy to. I think, yeah, you can assume that if we haven't interrupted you, we probably don't have any questions, but I guess we can. I can check with my colleagues. I should jump in with a couple questions that probably were relevant to what you just discussed. I'll give you a little chance to breief set, and thanks for the questioning us through this presentation. Can you describe a little bit more what makes, what makes it such that you can, you can see hitting the 2030 targets requirements using kind of existing technology, but 2040 is not doable with existing technology. I guess in my simple mind I would, I would think, well, so if you can hit 2030, then you can just do more and more and more of the same that got you down to the 2030 levels. And eventually you'll get to the 2040 levels, which is 100% decarbonization. Is it that the existing resources that the overbuild is so significant that it becomes cost prohibitive? Or is it that there actually are technology gaps that don't allow you to meet know your reliability requirements? If it was just the existing technology, even in a situation where you build a tenn of it, to have potentially overbuild the great question. So ignoring costs, the overbuild of the system. The problem with that solution is the correlation in renewable generation. So sun tends to shine at the same time, wind across the region tends to blow at the same time. And so because of those correlations in generation, you do have gaps and those gaps are filled by storage. Simply put, the, the storage that's plausibly available on the market is able to fill those gaps in 2030 only when you've got that natural gas backstop. And when I said before, the, the natural gas playing that backstop role, this is, this is why it's critical to have them not necessarily at full output. They're not running 100% of the time, but they are providing a critical backop as the storage isn't able to fill that at that time. However, once you get out to 2040 and you remove those natural gas plants, assuming no refueling, assuming just that",

        "text": " the trade offs can be evaluated and what those assumptions are should be considered. We can argue about what a DG rooftop system costs at 5, right. But we should be able at least get to attention where we're starting to see the edges of that and consider the policy solutions to it. It may be just like the paradigms aren't. The really different paradigms that we might have available to us aren't being evaluated when we stick with this. Sort of like what's possible. Yeah. And each of every solution path has its different challenges. Like the per unit cost of rooftop DG is more expensive, but it's probably cheaper and more timeline reliable than a billion dollar transmission line across the cascades. That should emerge from the analytical process for that trade off intention to be developed. And there's other benefits that, you know, that come from those things, you know, got it right. Batteries all over Portland could keep the lights on in emergencies, you know, and be timeline viable, whereas other things might not. And right now, I think the big thing that's being missed, you know, in a world where transmission is kind of everything, there are solutions, you know, the alternatives. If you properly constrain that in a model, a model shouldn't be able to assume it's anything if that's properly constrained. If any new line you say, you know, rebuttable presumption is going to take ten years to build, the model shouldn't be allowed to pick something that can't exist, then in which case it should be able to start grabbing things somewhere else. And those things might be more expensive on a per unit basis, etcetera. But we can see them and decide what incentives or whatever. Got it. Okay. Anything else, Commissioner Tanei, or. Okay, I appreciate you engaging on that point. That was really helpful. All right, we need to move on to renewable northwest now and then Sierra Club, and then we'll come back to pick up any public comment that we might have missed. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Thank you, chair Decker. Commissioner Tawi. For the record, this is Max Green for renewable knockest. Just want to start out with a quick note of appreciation before moving into some concerns, which is Pax'observation repeated a number of times in their reply comments that they are their plan does include bringing on over three gigawatts of new renewable non emitting storage resources, plus a significant amount of small scale resources for Oregon customers. Sort of helpful in setting a baseline before getting into the concerns. And we do agree that this piece is encouraging and appreciated. Packs sort of effort to quantify that by pointing to the sort of 2% deviation from what HP 2021 requires in 2030. That does, I think, put a finer point on the company's observation, which I think we agree with, that there are policy considerations embedded in the plan that we may not need to try to tackle in this docket now, which is great because there's a bunch of other stuff that we do need to tackle in this docket now, which I will get into now. One thing that we raised in our written comments that I don't think the company really responded to in their reply is a recommendation with the company transition from their capacity factor approximation method for individual resource capacity accreditation to something more modern, such as ELCC. In line with the commission's decision in, uM, 2011, the company sort of acknowledges renewable northwest made that point, but doesn't say whether they are actually going to do anything there. I think that's going to be increasingly important as the grid evolves. Similarly, an analysis of fot availability, they sort of say, hey, we recognize renewable northwest race. This is an issue, but they don't really address whether they're going to do anything on that. Again, an important emerging issue moving into stuff that I think is particularly relevant for the current plan or written comments discussed in some detail, significant upward adjustments that the company made to the costs of renewable resources in years following those year one values that are reflected in its basic supply side resource tables. The company's explanation for these increases is that they witnessed the impact of recent tighter trade tariffs and inflation and quot adjusted the cost more casts to reflect what was observed. I don't think that that is an explanation that provides adequate justification for the changes, nor would I be comfortable as a regulator saying that that's an adequate foundation for a determination that the plan is reasonable. I would press the company to provide more information on whats behind those adjustments. And if we accept that there is only a 2% deviation from the 2030 emissions reduction requirement, it's entirely possible that fixing those cost inputs could close that gap without the need to address some of those deeper compliance questions. That said, of course, there are also, as Cub discussed in some detail, some pressures pointing the other direction and potentially widening that gap between what the plan chose and what the company needs in 2030.",

        "text": "cker Commissionerani, you are the state of Oregon. And the state of Oregon has passed a law by the same entities that authorize the existence of your agency. The budget of your agency. The PUCC, even existing, has adopted a statute that says it is the policy of the state of Oregon to do these things to the maximum extent practical, that this emission free energy be reduced in the following manner. The policy statement is relevant to you at the commission as a primary platform to focus and prioritize your priorities. The law says that we shall accomplish these things and the utilities that you regulate shall accomplish these things. The relevance of how you go about that, which issues you choose to amplify, focus on, suppress, prioritize with your precious resources are directly informed by the policy statement of the state that is duly adopted. Right? The legislature said this is our policy. The governor signed it. This is the law. You are charged with implementing the policies of the state. It has been implied throughout this process that, including related to some other precedent, that we're asking you to directly contradict the plain language of the statute to do something that the statute says to do different. But nobody's asking you to do that. We have never asked to do that. What we have said is as you go about overseeing this decarbonization, the decarbonization which is entirely and wholy, the procurement of new energy resources from two utilities you regulate, that is what 100% clean is. It's new energy, new resources. So you wholly and entirely oversee that. That as you do so, you implement the policy. State that to the maximum extent practical, you do it in a manner that directs benefits to communities in the state. And so an increasing energy security, jobs, all of these things that you're aware of when you see the words to the maximum extent practicable, is it fair, I guess what comes into your mind with the word practicable? I think it's fair to say that there are many competing factors within HB 2021 and ISRT of practicability bound by those other policy interests stated in the law, in your view? Yeah, that's a great question. In contracts and statute, we, we use language to talk about the degree of efforts that are necessary, reasonable efforts, best efforts commercial efforts, you know, we'll try a little bit. We'll try a lot. This is uniquely strong language, and it was negotiated language. Right. This didn't come out of nowhere. That says that you'll use to the maximum of practical, which means to me, as the commission, you should be looking at what is actually practical and the trade off. And so that means when we go through the examples of how will this occur, we'll be procuring new energy. You know, is the maximumable, like cheaper, more benefits to communities, more environmental justice support? Yeah. So the maximum that you could do is to build everything in a way that accomplishes that. All of those things create resiliency, create jobs here. And so the logical analysis of that should be, if everything is built in Oregon, all of those things will create jobs in Oregon. If every battery, every dispatchable power plant is built attached to an Oregon city or so forth, it will increase resiliency. So then the question is, how much is too much and how do we balance that? Let's just assume that was 200% more expensive and studies showed it was less reliable than a more diversified portfolio. Would it still be practicable? Well, the issue is, Steven, the balance of doing that needs to be done, and it is not being done. We do not have the opportunity. Your implementation of the policy should be to secure the information to allow that balance to occur. We don't have that. We haven't seen the price of a versus b. And when we say in an RFP, you should consider in state benefits. The structure of the RFP, which is in your direction, in your discretion, as you implement this, should be to say, how do we get that information? Present that information, quantify that trade. The balance. Is it worth ten points or 50? Is, you know, what is that trade off? Currently the position has been that gets zero consideration. So the implementation of the policy, policy stage, the maximum should be figure out what it is and how much we can do, which is not like, to the extent it's not slightly expensive to theense, it's not like slightly hard, this is the maximum. And so your job is essentially to find out how far can you go before it isn't practicable, not slightly practical. And thus our ask of this as the relevance is to you to use your bully pulpit and your discretion and say, you know, you will facilitate utilities, you shall show us, you shall require bidders to quantify and demonstrate these things. You shall",

        "text": "Good morning, everyone. It's January 4, 2024. Happy New year. We're here for a special public meeting of the Wardn Public Utility Commission, and we're here today in docket number, um, 22 74 to discuss the Portland general elector request for proposals and many related issues. We have a lot to cover today and we, our administrative law judge issued a brief agenda. I'll put a little bit more color to sort of how we're going to walk through things today. The first thing that we'll do is kind of warm up the conversation by letting people make really pretty brief comments, introducing the most important issues to them. We may have a question or two for different parties during that phase, but as anyone who's looked at the record in the stock, it knows we have quite a number of very detailed issues to work through today. I will be asking people to stick to the timeline set forth in the agenda, which is five minute opening statements for the three most engaged parties, staff PGE and IPSsey, and then three minutes for anyone else that wishes to speak. At that stage, we will use the raise your hand feature to create a queue of others who are wanting to speak. We'llr of take a break after that and then come back with any big picture comments from the commissioners. And then we will be diving, driving in to the issues with the help of our administrative law judge, Katie Mapes, and staff Kim Herb. And we may have things that we want to explore further with the parties during that work session, but we have gotten a lot of written information from parties and like I said, with the number of issues that we have to work through, we probably won't have, won't be able to accommodate a significant amount of oral comment on an issue by issue basis. I really appreciate people respecting the constraints that we're under and working through these issues and being respectful of everyone else's time. If we do have a question for you during our work session, keeping it to the issue that we're asking about and not using the opportunity for broader advocacy. Okay. I think that one we'm going to just launch right into the opening comments, starting with PUC staff good morning. Good morning. Can you hear m oka? Yes. Great. Good morning. Chair Eker and Commissioner Tanei. For the record, my name is Kim Herb. I'm the utility strategy and planning manager with OPUC staff. And with me today is staff counsel Joanna Remus Schneider and Frank Mossberg, representing Bates White, independent evaluator. This morning I'll provide a very brief overview of staff's report on Portland General Electric's 2023 all source RFP, which addresses three broad issues. First, consideration that the RFP scoring and modeling methodology. Second, consideration of draft RFP itself. Third, consideration of the participation in this RFP of PGE's recently approved affiliate Portland renewable resource company, referred to throughout as PR. For context, I'd like to provide you someief briefs backgrounds on January 31 and 2023, PGE filed an application seeking to commence the RFP process, including competitive bidding rule waiver requests intended to expedite procurement efforts to meet urgent near term and growing energy and capacity needs that the company had identified in its development of its 2023 CEP IRP, which is currently being considered in LC 81 of the waiver requests that was granted included combining the review of the draft RFP and the associated scoring and modeling methodology, which is why both of those elements are being considered at this time. In August, PGE filed a motions toend the procedural schedule while it addressed outstanding issues regarding PRR in docket UI 489. These issues were addressed on October 18, 2023, and this RFP docket resumed activities in early November. The staff report in UI 489 called out potential concerns about activities of the affiliate if gone unchecked, and the commission is stated that given the risk to the competitive market and ratepayers attributable to transactions between PGE and its affiliates, that the RFP process must review and consider these unique risks and ensure that they're addressed. As such, staff added an additional round of feedback from stakeholders to further identify and address risks regarding PRRs participation in this RFP staff is grateful for the high level of engagement and valuable comments received by stakeholders, the responsive and thoughtful communication with the company and the expertise and analysis provided by Bates White throughout the process regarding the issuance of the RFP at a high level. Staff funds that PGE draft 2023 all source RFP with conditions recommended by staff complies with the commission's competitive bidding rules and staff recommends issuance staying within the confines of the competitive bidding rules. Staff's primary approach in its review and its development of recommendations was be responsive to PGE? S stated need and limited transmission options by expanding the universe of potential bids and reducing barriers to entry, and also to be responsive to what staff heard from stakeholders regarding competitiveness and confidentiality concerns by",

        "text": " lot of PUC matters as we look at the resources effectively. If I'm reading this and understanding correctly, staff recommending against using the curve that the market views as the energy price because it's too high. Like, I don't really understand that logic. And I don't understand how that's sort of being flushed out and properly analyzed in terms of what it avoids or how we're thinking about all kinds of resources, including effectively, this chart here. Figure one on page six of the report essentially highlights this. Tens if not $150, sometimes a megawatt hour gap between the IRP models that are being modeled in Aurora that are apparently in the IRP you recently acknowledged. And what the actual market believes is happening. And we've been monitoring the forward price curves the last couple of years. And you it is common that August has been forecasted to be $180 200. All sorts of other numbers that are substantially different. I guess across this and other issues that are jumping out here. We're struggling to understand how this has actually been properly examined. And it seems like it might be severely shorting the energy efficiency, avoided cost. But also affecting and creating conclusions that haven't been properly briefed and so forth. On the basis ofoed cost methodologies and inputs that are going to affect other dockets like, um, 2000 and so forth. So it feels like there's an. Can I ask if your concern is primarily precedential for other proceedings or if you are deeply concerned about the energy efficiency, avoided cost values, I would say all of the above. And as somebody that focuses on the transmission constraints in particular, you know, the proper, you know, the energy efficiency has a unique ability to move the needle in a huge manner on how much transmission, peak transmission that we need, how much needs to be built overall and or how much peak resources need to be built. So our decarbonization milestones, objectives, the resources we need for capacity resources as well as transmission move materially if you're moving effectively the peak by moving it down with energy efficiency. So we have a big concern there. I think we also just see weird back feed loops and concerning things as relates to the IRP in here. But yes, we're also concerned about how this affects other dockets and that, like if stakeholders that are affected by this haven't been properly consulted, had opportunity to participate and address these issues, but most of all, the entire future of clean capacity is going to be defined by batteries. And it feels like we're just willy nilly saying 4 hours while which may be a common industry convention to address certain peaks. But where has that been properly addressed? I mean, that flows through all over the place. IRP avoided cost hereoed, cost there, and that could easily double this number or what is the basis of that? We don't see any reason the basis of that presented, which is concerning. Thank you. Any questions for Jake? Not so much for Jake. I guess I would ask Peter, we did talk about this particular issue in this and yeah, we can, Commissioner Perkins, maybe circle back to Peter sort of at the, after we hear all the public comment and ask him any follow up questions. I just don't want to. Commissioner decker, if I may, back and forth. Yeah, I think our suggestion, having not had time to probably dig into this, is that some of this feels like something that looks like an interim solution with deeper investigation and key issues as opposed to permanently adopting a precedent or something to that point. Thank you. Great. Thank you for your comments, Jake. I appreciate that. Did you have other questions for Jake less or, sorry, commissioner programs or did you want to just circle back to p. Okay. All right. I need to ask whether there are any other public comments on this matter. Looks like not so, Peter, why don't you come on back up and Commissioner Perkins, why don't you go ahead and ask your question to feed her or you can just talk about ye, I guess I would just ask Peter to address the comments that Jake made. Sure. Happy to. Thanks. Commissioner Perkinson chair Decker so I think what sounds like. Well, there are number of factors to speak to here. So, as alluded to in my opening comments, we did have a public workshop on this on April 4. I will also point out that the PGE value came in after that, that meeting on April 4, so was submitt on April 9. Staff did meet with the company to discuss the value. And I guess while the company characterized it as. As incorrect, I think our, our discussion and some of the back and forth in other dockets, including um. 1728, kind of provided an insight that it wasn't just this grant pud extension contract, but really an averaging over the ELC'planning horizon that",

        "text": " on the interim rate will be reduced to four premium peak hours per day identified by each utility based on a given month loss of load probability. These premium peak hours are designed to signal the most valuable hours for dispatch of stored QF energy in alignment with utility needs, just as the modeled proxy resour is assumed to dispatch whenever possible during these premium peak hours. Because this is a new, somewhat experimental rate, staff is proposing a 50 megawatt threshold per utility at which the commission will review the rate and solar plus storage projects over 100 receive the standalone solar rate. Staff also proposes that the utility can adjust the four premium peak hours for existing contracts following and acknowledge IRP where the analysis supports moving the hours. While the utility parties commented that only allowing qs matching the design of the proxy should be eligible for the interim rate, staff believes that the recommended volumetric capacity payment structure will allow qs to make economic decisions about project design within a limited range of configurations and protect ratepayers from overpaying by providing a reasonably smaller capacity payment for qfs with smaller batteries. While staff is not certain what QF projects will look like or what is appropriate given prices, supply constraints, and other factors, we prefer to provide some bounds around eligibility in order to promote resources that provide additional value and to generate empirical usage information about such hybrid resources for usee. In the UM 2000 investigation at large, the flexibility of staff's eligibility recommendation is also balanced by the 50 megawatt availability tranche and the ability to disaggregate and adjust premium peak hours during the contract. NAN energy commented in opposition to the 50 megawatt per utility cap, saying it will disinceentivize qfs and is unnecessary given that the rate is interim and that the commission will have redress available through UM 2000 should the rate not operate as intended given that this is anedited process to employ novel technology, staff sees the 50 megawatt cap as a prudent measure to protect ratepayers from any unintended outcomes, and staff will work with all deliberate speed to review and address the rate to provide relief to any otherwise eligible qfs should the cap be reached. Staff's proposal does permit premium peak hours to be adjusted over the course of the standard contract after the acknowledgement of an IRP or IRP update. The Community Renewable Energy Association, Northwest and Intermountain Power Producers Coalition and the Renewable Energy Coalition have commented in opposition to this provision, proposing alternatively that creating multiple standard rates is preferable, one with the ability to adjust premium peak hours and one rate with premium peak hours fixed throughout the contract. While staff understands KA's concerns, this process is meant to be expedited and to provide administrative simplicity. Adding an additional rate for one contract design element would be in contravention to the overall goals of this interim rate process, and further, staff and stakeholders will have the ability to review the potential impact of any proposed peak hour changes post IRP or IRP update. Acknowledgement SN staff also sees the ability to update the premium peak hours as potentially protecting ratepayers from overpayment should a utility's capacity needs shift meaningfully over the course of QF contract staff views the optionality as ensuring greater value that storage dispatchability provides without harming a QF's ability to collect capacity payments. This expedited approach may not reflect the compleity complexity of pricing methods that will be considered in future phases of UM 2000, or the range of operational opportunities that storage technologies could provide, but it does allow an appropriate interim path forward in alignment with policy goals that protects rate payers while being a potential benefit to all parties. This concludes my comments and I'm available to answer any questions. Thanks very much Ryan. Are there any questions for staff to get us started here on this one? I guess I have one question. It feels like there is this issue of how the or weather and how the hours designated for payment of the capacity value can be changed through the course of the contract is really a meaningful one. And I think, I guess you offered in your memo an invitation for the QF parties to say are there some boundaries? Are there some changes that would be particularly troublesome that we can kind of take off the table? And what they came back with was something that said you should have one rate where it doesn't change and one rate where it does change. And if I'm being honest, that strikes me as pretty administratively complex for something that's supposed to bet a quick pilot program. Was there any more discussion of the more or less problematic changes that could be taken off the table to create more certainty around the way the hours might change over the course of a contract or not? I guess I would say that staff has not seen objective analysis demonstrating the harms of potential peak hour changes that might harm qfs. The worst case scenario that was offered suggesting moving the peak hours into midday solar production times. It's unclear that that is going to harm qs potential to capture",

        "text": " of key answers to that. One is, of course, that if we're implementing the law under purpa, the avoided costs, you know, there's a requirement that we actually have accurate rates and that we can't effectively achieve that by having inputs which are demonstrably inaccurate or suspect. And in combination with that, we are in a time where we have HP 221 as a law. And as I think the commission has pointed out, there's obligations of the commission to ensure that they facilitate rapid reductions, greenhouse emissions and along with the other statutory standards, and effectively, if there's rates that are completely non viable and where there's a reason to believe that the assumptions into those are inaccurate, as I'll go through some examples of, then there's an obligation to address this at this time and get us, if nothing else, in the ballpark of viability and facilitate encouraging qfs in the state, including so they can support the decarbonization mandates of the state and PG's ability to make rapid progress and rapid reductions under those Php 221 statutes. So I'd like to highlight a few issues. One, you know, as relates to what's going on, since the last few weeks, the us government has announced new tariffs on solar modules even since the bids went into the PGERFP. Currently those are pretty substantial tariffs on chinese modules. And do the supply chain effectively affect a lot of the production throughout the world is the inability to get non chinese poly into modules. And even the companies that don't produce modules in China or use chinese supply are then put in a position to essentially profiteer off of the margin, you know, and capture that, whether that's domestically manufactured or manufactured somewhere else, like Indonesia or something that might not be affected by those tariffs. So even the latest bids into PG's current RFP are inaccurate, you know, in terms of the resources that are available to be avoided. I think the Clearwater bids and the transmission situation associated with that, that demonstrated there isn't additional transmission, essentially established that the next resource isn't a wind project that can get long term firm transmission to PG system because that's effectively been maxed out and they were unable to get the transmission and even met their own bidding criteria, much less the 100% which is imposed by contract requirement on all qfs in Oregon according to your standard contract policies. But even without that QF nexus, that next project is not going to be a wind project in Montana to the extent that it was. The transmission and interconnection costs associated with such a weed resource do not include the 100 miles Geni that Clearwater depended on, and the cost and so forth associated with that. Those haven't been examined, nor have we properly addressed and dealt with the changes in interconnection costs in PGE's current model and work papers, which do not assume updates for what it actually cost Bonneville to do things now. And I can speak from experience that as a costs basis that we had in Bonneville studies and interconnection agreements, having recently executed them with Bonneville, and having been involved in that intimately on a weekly and monthly basis for the past eight years, Bonneville's costs have effectively tripled over the last several years. And so we've gone from initial expectations, you know, $5 million is what we paid for our last 115 interconnections. Those days are long gone, and they're being compounded now further by the tariffs which are also being imposed by the US on steel and so forth. We have a lot of upward pressure on all of those costs, all of which are also wrong in PGE's work papers and based on outdated assumptions. Similarly, the market supply curves upon which these avoided cost models are based are inaccurate, including because of Pacific Corp's own filings in its vo cost update and on its RFP dockets, which I guess we take notice of here, because they have essentially removed the entire RFP procurement, which has been, as I mentioned in a previous work session or public comment that we have learned, is effectively assumed in the forward supply curves for generation in the northwest, that they are assuming the utilities IRP assumptions. So the approval of commission of this commission, of those assumptions in the past, for example, based on PAC's last IRP before the update, is what is baked in and assumes 20,000 mw or something of clean energy procurement, which functionally will not exist. And they have entered into the records with you that they do not intend to procure such. So those supply curves which PGE's model is based on are also then demonstrably inaccurate and probably over assuming the constructed supply that will be built in the northwest by 20 or 30,000 additional generation, which is then further constrained by the inability of the transmission system to support additional delivery, especially the Portland system. And we have now the Bonneville TP report from the last study, which establishes essentially a litany of ten to 20 year new wires projects that",

        "text": " sec? I really appreciate you making the point that this thinking that's happening about other ways of measuring resource out of SE is not necessarily purely academic forever. The wrap has a process in place place by which you could consider other metrics to be used by the program in the future. Yes, I think that's exactly. We do have the robust stakeholder engagement process. We've talked a lot, especially to new entities, the ones who haven't been involved in a lot of these conversations that are further afield, they're interested in how do I make this work for me, I think that's a similar conversation. We've got this process where any one can turn in an idea, but I think we're also just feeling like there's a lot of conversation happening about what is the right planning metric, as every nationwide people are feeling much shorter and wondering whether the one event day in ten years is the right metric to be planning to, or whether there needs to be some deepening of that. So we're watching that and certainly interested in whether we should think about that for the future. But we're still really focused on getting the program up and running first. Okay, thanks. Yeah, thanks chair. Okay. So then, as we've mentioned, and I think we're all familiar, the participant compliance obligation is to show up seven months in advance of the start of a season to demonstrate that you have physically firm resources to meet your p 50 plus PrM. So your peak p 50 load plus the regional planning reserve margin, which at this point we have two regions, a northwest and a southwest and east region. I have a slide, the next slide is going to talk a little about the transmission requirement that happens on the same timeline. But I thought from what I've heard, hopely you'll jump in with questions. Might be interesting for a conversation is noting one the Loe and the ELCC modeling that we're doing. So that's the loss of load modeling and the effective load carrying capability of variable energy resources and energy storage resources. It's going to be done on the participants in the program. That's a bit different, as I think folks at WEC have pointed out, than the footprint wide or the interconnect wide modeling. So we do have some limitation there. Of course, we would love to have everyone in the footprint in the same program and that would really help. But as'folks who are voluntarily submitting to these compliance requirements, because the operational side of that, their obligation to each other to share, is how we can guarantee that we are getting closer to that reliability metric. If it were simply based on market dynamics, we wouldn't have the ability to ensure that folks are obligated to actually share with each other. So it's that implementation side that we're trying to bring to the table. So the modeling that we do is based on participants and we collect that data about two years before the season that we're working towards and then we share that information with them a year before they're showing then happened. So that's seven months before the season and then a year before that is when we set a PRM for the season in question. It's almost two years before the season that we actually set the planning reserve margin and the capacity contribution of variable energy resources. I think it's important for your conversations as well to note that we have, we give, it's kind of a two year outlook and then a five year out look so we do try and provide that forward look, it's just not obligated. There's no compliance requirement for that five year ahead look, it's only that two year aheadok that actually has a showing with it. We provide information for folks. So the loss of load, we give a five year planning reserve margin. That's indicative. And then we give a curve for the ELCC related thing. So your variable energy resources like wind, solar, and then energy storage like batteries will give a curve that says if you add 2000 mw, this is what the ELCC would be the capacity value of that resource. If you added 4000, if you added 6000, I think that's the right increment. Rebecca, can I ask you a modeling question? You articulate there at the top of the slide that you're using the one event day and ten years, but the regional planning reserve margin is applied to a p 50 or one and two peak load. So is that sort of youe taking a point load forecast and then doing the probabilistic analysis of sort of other stuff or, you know, because WEC is doing the curve of load, right. You could have high load and low resource day and have a problem. Can you talk to me just a little bit about what that p 50 load means? Yeah. So the p 50 load to start there is really just a function of how we allocate it back to participants. So what we're really looking for is when we look at the full footprint of rap participating entities, we take all of their load information, historical load information,",

Ok. All right. So why don't you give us whatever opening you had. I think we can skip over the ones that feel resolved and rely on others to bring those up if they're not. Absolutely. Thank you very much, Che DeCr. So I will begin if it makes sense to you, I wouldrt take these and order from what I consider sort of the least controversial up towards the most. So one that remains sort of outstanding is staff'rFP, condition four, which would have required the, and this is one for background that Idaho power has agreed to. But there is an issue. We just wanted to make sure that Nipsey is sort of satisfied with the new language. So this was an element of the bid eligibility criteria that originally required bidders to provide some sort of documentation demonstrating that they were going, that they had proposed a viable commercial operation date. But there was really no detail in there about what documentation would be considered sufficient for that purpose. So we and, you know, n Nipsey had actually raised this issue, seeking additional clarification. So in our recommendation, we sort of pulled some language from a prior RFP, just giving some examples of documentation that could be used to demonstrate the viability of a commercial operation date. And in its reply comments to the staff report, Nipsey actually suggested that we had perhaps overshot the mark a little bit by sort of pulling criteria that were really from sort of further down the procedural pipeline rather than an initial bid criteria. We may have set like, sort of two stringent standards, for example, by demonstrating that proof of equipment delivery on site and things like that, we're maybe a little bit too aggressive. So Nipsey had actually proposed in its reply comments, some amended language for this condition, which, you know, from our perspective, staff is supportive of that amended language from Nipsey, but we have not yet confirmed with the company whether that is acceptable to them. Do you want to say, sorry, did I hear you say that that amended language is in your staff report or that you have some amended language that you'd like to propose right now? Now, Nipsey had provided some amended language it's not in the staff report. Nipsey had provided some amended language in its reply comments. So it's oay. All right, thanks. So, Adam, I think we'd be looking for some kind of quick reaction from Idaho power on Nipsey's recommended language. You can provide that now if you want. For the sake of breity. Yeah. And subject to one of my clients jumping in to correct. I suspect we're comfortable with that language. We'comfortable. With staffs. So dialing. Great. Thanks. Okay, thanks, Adam. So go ahead, pat, with your next one. Oop. You're on mute. Yes, I am. Thank you very much, Terur Decker. So the next one that remains outstanding is, I think, RFP condition seven, which would have required Idaho power to remove a section which was section 8.5 titled the negotiation of facility purchase. From the draft form agreements in which it appears, which were the PPA and battery storage, the power purchase and battery storage agreements. In the initial form contract, there was a requirement that upon signing a PPA or a BSA, the seller must agree to immediately enter into good faith negotiations with Idaho Power to sell the assets, their assets to the company. Nipsey, in its initial comments, which were, I believe in March, a month or two ago at this .6 weeks ago at this point, had flagged this issue and suggested that this would be effectively trying to convert the PPA and BSA agreements into build transfer agreements. We obviously shared that concern. The object of our competitive bidding rules is to allow for a variety of different ownership and contractual structures and to ensure in competitive market. So we, in our recommendation, suggested removing this language entirely. We had had some conversations back and forth with the company. They had provided some amended language that sort of softened the requirement a little bit. So it was no longer a strict requirement to immediately enter into negotiations, but would instead just invite the sellers to explore options for sale. We appreciated the back and forth with Idaho power",
